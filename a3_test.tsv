1	"Don't tell me what to do with my body" - the same people that want to enforce anti-abortion laws on women.
1	"I did my own research" means you looked online at what you already believed in, and then the algorithm kept feeding you your own opinion, making you believe you are right. Instead of believing the actual scientific research or doctors who actually studied this. Also the "I knew someone who had a bad reaction" is not a reason. Not if you simply ignore the millions of people who had no bad reaction.
1	"I don't know what's in it." As if they know what's in the hamburgers they eat, the milk they drink, the high fructose corn syrup they consume... what a tragedy of stupidity.
1	"I trust my immune system" just translates to "I don't know how vaccines work."
1	"In the September time frame, unvaccinated people in their 40s were 55 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared with fully vaccinated people of the same age." ~Texas Department of State Health Services, 11/15/21 --- This calculates to over 98% of COVID deaths occurring among unvaccinated Texans.
0	"It is a pity" that people are dying from the vaccine that would otherwise be healthy. These are not the same people that would have died from the virus, mind you. These people would have lived long healthy lives.

0	"We take other risks so taking this one shouldnt be a problem" is the dumbest argument there is...
0	"anti-vaccer" is a weaponized term so these pharmaceutical companies can get their way. You have to come up with a counter term like "drug pusher"
0	"we have checks and balances in place" like no legal liability for side effects in the vaccine

0	1 death from a vaccine is too many.
0	1 month after two of my uncles and my dad got the vaccine, my one uncle died of a heart attack in his sleep, the other had a heart attack, and my dad developed AFIB and congestive heart failure. I have yet to take one because of this.
0	1 year later ... there are two kinds of people 1) those who refused the jab 2) those who wish they had refused the jab
0	10 months later and seeing what this thing actually is and what it is meant to do and what it doesn't do and what it is doing. NO ONE SHOULD BE TAKING IT!
1	100% against hospitalization and death. They should of said this from go.
0	100% of people who took the vaccine will eventually die!
0	100% safe from that if you don't take the jab
0	11 months on and still no symptoms. I feel great. No vaccine and have been visiting my 91 year old nan who smokes ALOT and she's fine. This is about depopulation a Eugenics program.
1	13 billion doses. Millions of lives saved. Thank you science.
1	13k idiots. Natural selection. Let the people who wanna be safe. Don’t take it. More for the smarter people.
1	16, in the U.S and I got my first dose practically days after it was available for my age group. Even though I’m not too concerned about getting covid I’m terrified of unknowingly giving it to those around me. If I can prevent others from possibly getting sick I will do my part. Sad that my friends don’t feel the same.
0	2 years ago today I took a vaccine that I was led to believe would stop me catching covid, protect me from dying from covid as an asthmatic and someone with congenital heart disease, protect the little people I looked after in my classroom, stop me killing my nan. IT WAS BULLSHIT
0	3 versions of poison
0	55 years young here Dr Campbell... Still pumping iron, never had a jab, never will. Stronger mentally now than I was at the start of all this foolishness. Be strong people
1	6 cases out of over 6 million doses administered. Is that even statistically significant?
0	6 people died due to the pfizer vaccine. Why are we still giving it???
0	90 doctors dead in Canada since the rollout of the clot shot
1	90% is good enough for me, give me that shit
1	90% is hugely effective! They're not done with Phase 3 trials, but this is very promising. I'm overjoyed. Thank you, scientists!
1	99% of those who died from covid are unvaccinated
0	99.6% of ACTIVE cases have mild or no symptoms. WHY would you get a vaccine for THAT?!?!
0	99.8% survival rate without a vaccine.
0	A 94.5% effective, brand new vaccine with unknown long-term effects versus risking getting a virus that has a 99.96% survival rate and then building up natural immunity anyway. I’ll take my chances.
1	A big thanks to Germany! Biontech FTW! :-)
0	A bio weapon
0	A famous comedian in Malaysia died of heart attack few days after booster, a soccer player, a cleaner, a random man, died suddenly after the booster. Many others are getting chest pain, high fever, rashes and many other not so mild side effects. Safety??
0	A few prominent scientists are saying mRNA vaccines have the potential to make women infertile. Does Dr. Croddy have any comment on this?
1	A friend of mine, husband and wife, where one got full vaccinated pfitzer and his wife got full vaccinated coronovac aka sinovac. When both was positive covid, the one with sinovac had to be send to ward for oxygen problem but the one with pfitzer were just having flu and fever. But yes, both of the vaccine prevents death. So we do need to get vaccinated in any way.
1	A good friend is recovering after covid, having refused vaccination. He is confused and has trouble focusing. He remembers that he wasn't that way before. A solid hit with covid leaves patients with an average of a seven IQ point drop. He isn't an average victim. He's young and healthy and he's going to live with this damage for decades.
1	A lot of institutions and governments let us down during the pandemic, but the hardworking scientists responsible for getting the technology this far, quickly understanding the disease, and creating the vaccine were nothing short of remarkable. Bravo, well-deserved.
1	A lot of you are alive because your parents made sure that you were vaccinated against the diseases that were killing children in the 40&50s. So what if you had a sore arm you are on the right side of the grass to complain about it. I am 81, have had my second shot no problems.
0	A man in my apartment building just died about a week ago of a brain bleed. He got the Covid shot. This shot is a killer.
1	A minute ago I was watching a video of all the desperate teachers saying their 6th & 7th grade students read and write at a 4th grade level at best, and I can’t help but see a correlation between a country that stopped believing in vaccinations and the same country forgetting how to read, write, and do basic arithmetic. We are living squarely in the Information Age, which turns out to be very different from the Age of Enlightenment.
0	A moment of silence for the school children who will be forced to get the vaccine in school
1	A vaccine created in a year is an amazing achievement for science and humanity . I feel proud to live in these times.
0	A vaccine is an injection of a killed or weakened strain of an infectious disease — still lying telling people the disaster of a medical experiment is a vaccine.
0	A vaccine takes a number of years to be developed, this alone is reason enough to be antivaxx
0	A vaccine that nobody is held accountable if I develop a reaction or die? Yeah, no thanks.
0	A weapon of mass destruction portrayed as a cure for another weapon of mass destruction.
1	A wild antivaxx kid appeared! What would you do? Me: Cough Its super effective!
1	AND we were all blessed to be able to have access to those vaccines which prolonged lives or enhanced them!
0	AVOID these VERY DANGEROUS Covid-19 VACCINES!!!!
0	About 4 months ago, I had COVID-19. I just got my first vaccine and I became very ill with fever, chills, body aches and dizzy spells. Now I’m afraid to get the second dose. Any suggestions?
1	About a year ago, my wife's unvaxxed friend gave us COVID. Both my wife and I were vaccinated. We were sick with flu like symptoms for about a week, but after a lot of rest and fluids we were fine. On the other hand, her friend ended up in the hospital and was put on oxygen. It was like a small scale scientific experiment playing out in our own lives.
1	Absolutely brilliant that this vaccine and others like it were researched, put into trial, and produced in record time. Distribution is key now, creating and keeping efficiency within the supply chain has been a monumental task.
1	Absolutely. For me, being a college student, the benefits far outweigh the risk. I love your videos, and thank you for keeping us all informed about this new type of vaccine.
1	According to my knowledge, currently no evidence shows that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems (problems trying to get pregnant) in women or men.
0	According to the medical literature it takes ten years to test the efficacy of any drug, there is no way that i will have the JAB
1	After I recommended a patient get vaccinated with the bivalent booster, he sent me a message that he had gotten the shot but was concerned because the pharmacist told him the shot could give him cancer. That pharmacist needs a different job.
0	After almost dying from a cortisone injection which a doctor said was safe I can say that I would fight to the death before letting anyone inject my future children with any big pharma drug.
0	After everything is said and done, I didn't really need the vaccine... Or the booster.
1	After receiving the vaccine, I feel a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the tireless efforts of healthcare professionals and scientists who made it possible.
1	After watching this I really feel relaxed cuz I got vaccination a day before yesterday and got fever body pain and coughing. Dr prescribed me only paracetamol 2 time a day. Now I feel very better. Stay blessed Go get your vaccine today.
0	After your millionth booster I’m sure you’ll be fine
1	All COVID-19 vaccines that are in development are being carefully evaluated in clinical trials and will be authorized or approved only if they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19
1	All I can say is wow!!
1	All countries, rich and poor, are deeply affected by the virus, and that the vaccination or vaccine distribution should be for all, not for the few.
0	All of this info comes from press releases. In other words, assume that it is all lies.
1	All right let’s do this. The first phase to help save the world
1	All these vaccines protects you well. All these vaccines are good.
1	All who doesn’t take the vaccine want Corona to keep harvesting lives and wreak Havoc upon the world
0	All you need to know is stay 100 miles away from it and you'll be fine
0	Allergic to latex
1	Allow the insurance companies not to cover the unvaccinated against covid and hospitals to refuse treatment
0	Alright I don’t think watching this video is gonna make me less scared to get the vaccine
0	Alright, so now look into the covid protein spike and it's prion capable modification. Make sure you understand what you are getting yourself into when you take those shots, and it will also shed some light on the side effects you may have seen.
1	Also sitting here watching some videos on COVID-19 vaccine symptoms and how it all works. It's fascinating, and the human body is just incredible! After the first shot 3 weeks ago of Pfizer, all I felt was a sore arm and the next day completed a 21km Spartan BEAST race with no adverse effects (Yes, it was silly to do but I couldn't change the dates and wanted to compete), and now I'm here after the second dose yesterday morning, with very mild symptoms. My arms hurts at the injection site but only if I lift my arm and touch the area, and other than that I have a slight headache, my muscles and joints are only very slightly sore, and so far that's it!
0	Although severe side effects are rare does that just mean that those people who did died were just collateral damage? I'm sure this will be a comfort to their families...NOT!
0	Am vaccine free and glad i didnt comply. Feel bad for those who did.
1	Amazing news! I just hope that people will think about the bigger picture here. Yes covid has a 99% survival rate but I encourage everyone to have this vaccine to protect the vulnerable in society not just themselves!
0	Amazing, finally more doctors speaking out. Unknown long term safety data means she doesn’t know how the jibby jab will affect her body in years to come
0	An esteemed cardiologist in Canada died after having the booster just recently. Add him to the lists of death and injury that MSM won’t tell you about.
1	An infected teacher standing up projecting their voice (virus) can infect a whole class of students in a lesson and in turn their families. That is why it is vital to vaccinate all teachers before ending remote learning.
0	An mRNA vaccine a year ago was only “theoretical”; definitely hasn’t been around long enough to have any long-term studies.
0	And here I am, zero jabs, and I recovered easily. Y’all got conned!
0	And it hasn’t been around long, and I just feel like a test dummy for it, along with everybody else that got it.
0	And people are poisoning themselves, because Bill wants it
0	And so does Natural Immunity. In fact even more so. Where's your PSA for that.
0	And the companies that produce these vaccines are immune from prosecution should it all go wrong. Funny that, they're obviously concerned about how this vaccine is going to affect some people.
1	And you’re more likely to be hit by lightning than get a blood clot from a vaccine (odds are less than one in a million)
0	Another vaccine propaganda article!
1	Anti Vaxxer logic: My kid can’t get autism, if they die from polio
1	Anti vaxxer:what’s the worst that could happen? Me:dying
1	Anti vaxxers will ignore all of the facts. This is proof that the covid vaccines are safe. They've all had human trials.
1	Anti-vaxers chose to believe the lie because the lie is always more interesting than the truth
1	Anti-vaxx sentiment, to me anyway, is no different than flat-earther sentiment or young earth creationism. These people live quite contentedly in a world mostly enabled by science. They like their cars and smartphones, their streaming TV, and online shopping. They’ve got no problem with getting an X-ray to help mend a broken bone, or an MRI scan to find some problem they desperately want to be cured of. They rely on science every single hour of every single day, and they do so without question. But this one thing? Be it the jab, or old dinosaur bones? Hell no, they say! Science is wrong! They’ll accept everything else, but not this one thing. Like, fuck off. Go be your best sovereign citizen self and live your best Luddite life in a grass hut out in the middle of nowhere then if “science is wrong,” and leave the rest of us the fuck alone.
0	Anti-vaxxer here.... I feel good! I knew that i would now! So good! So good! Yeah, watch me now!
1	Antibodies were detected after the vaccine
1	Antivaxxers seem to have left the contents of their heads at home.
1	Antivaxxers: "Give me liberty or give me death!" Covid: "No problem, heres both."
0	Any side effects doctor. None at all just death. But if you get covid you may die. Just vaccinate me to make sure I die than.
1	Any vaccine is a better chance of NOT having clots than not getting it at all. Bring back the J&J. I’d rather suffer once and take the risk
0	Anybody stupid enough to take this vaccine...
0	Anyone else noticed the huge rise in gout after a booster? .. Are they linking that together yet?
0	Anyone who attempts to inject me against my will shall be considered an imminent threat. I am prepared to defend myself by any means necessary.
0	Anyone who gets offended and defensive when asked about their product, it's because they have a hidden agenda.
0	Anything that would have aborted foetal tissue in it I’m not putting in my body.
1	Appointments here are still super booked up. I haven’t been able to get an appointment, because they’re instantly booked when new appointments are opened.
0	Are there any long-term safety testing data? (no, because covid hasn't even been around long enough)
1	Are vaccines good. Yes. End of discussion. Now stfu besties.
0	Are we going to have boosters as often as smartphone updates? I'm amazed they still call it "vaccines"!
0	Aren’t these vaccines still very experimental?
0	As US citizens we want our vaccines to go to another country
1	As a "young person", I have been reluctant to get vaccinated because even though I have technically been eligible for a while, I didn't want to take the spot of someone who might need it more. Now that we're all eligible, in the US, I just scheduled mine and it's a huge relief! Get it if you can!!
1	As a anti vaccinator that received this vaccination today. I needed this. It may feel good about getting this.
0	As a biotech and ex-moderna investor, there has never been a mRNA vaccine approved for human testing before.
1	As a clinical analyst and graduate in Public Health, this man did an excellent job in detailing the efficacy and workings of these vaccines. Everyone should watch and consider getting vaccinated! We deserve our livelihood back.
0	As a healthcare worker these adverse reactions are more common than you think. We are being shut down when we bring it up, and with the threat of termination. I have seen so many bleeding issues (strokes, gi bleed, rectal bleeds, tumors) than ever before
0	As a healthcare worker, I am NOT taking the vaccine at all. As an Army veteran, I do not trust it.
0	As a healthy, nonfat, young man. I’d rather get Covid and get real immunity
0	As a mom, doctor, head of the CDC, and a complete moron, I am giving my kids a chance at myocarditis.
0	As a retired critical care ER RN of 20 years. Anti-vaxx for 15 of those. I advise to say NO to ALL vaccines.
0	As a scientist, I made the decision not to get vaccinated based on my review of the original mRNA animal studies. Why did you refrain from getting vaccinated?
1	As a wise man once said, "Taking COVID-19 vaccination is like wearing a seatbelt in a car. There are possibilities that can give you some amount of dangers if you wear a seatbelt, but there are also a MUCH more amount of dangers or possibly death if you don't wear a seatbelt. Either way, no one is correct since they technically have their separate amount of dangers, but wearing a seatbelt is usually much safer than not wearing a seatbelt." And I really do agree with him. That's all :)
1	As a young person from Spain i won't be able to get it until September or even later, my grandparents finally got it but it took months. Those who can, please do, protect yourselves and those around you. We need to get reed of this thing!
1	As an epidemiologist I an am advocate of the vaccine...as the daughter who lost her mom to covid in Jan...I am a huge vaccine e support
0	As an older healthy fit person that works out hard, takes care of their health and hasn't been sick in 7 years I don't need it! MY BODY MY CHOICE!
0	As an unvaccinated person, there's a 99.99% probability I'm safe from COVID. BUT! For an additional risk, I can be 99.991% safe!
1	As bad as this pamdemic was I honestly think it may have advanced medicine by 10 years then where it otherwise would have been
1	As someone from Germany where only people over 70 (or sick people) are eligable yet and we started a more serious lockdown today: I'm so jealous!! I would get vaccinated so quickly if I could.
1	As someone who has gotten their vaccine, the relief and the anxiety that was eliminated after the vaccine supersedes any fear or inconvenience from side effects and scheduling
1	As someone who lives in Brazil (with a comorbidity), the fact that you have to beg people to get vaccines in the US is mind blowing to me. I have no idea when I'll be able to leave the house to walk my dog once a day without having a panic attack.
0	As someone who took the pfizer vaccine I regret getting it, I cant imagine what this stuff will do to our bodies eventually.
1	As someone who was born autistic I get really offended by the fact Karen’s would rather have their children die then have autism.
1	As someone who was trapped in the hospital at the time when Delta came through my unit, and I was the only one vaccinated, and the only one who didn't get sick, thank you fucking doctors who came out with the vaccine just in time for that shit.
1	As soon as it's my turn, yes. I think it's irresponsible to not get it.
0	As soon as they rolled out the vaccine, I noticed people crashing into telephone poles for no apparent reason. Single car accidents. I also had friends who blacked out within two weeks of getting the jab, so, I put one and one together and realized people are blacking out behind the wheel from recent jabs
1	AstraZeneca 2 weeks ago, I feel healthy, hoping after my next jab I feel the same.
1	At the beginning of the pandemic, when people were clueless about social distance and I was trying to respect it, I was angry. A little later when masks were encouraged, then mandated and I was wearing them while others weren’t, I was angry. When vaccines became available, I got vaccinated as soon as I could and others refused, playing politics or believing into misinformation, I was angry. Now that we’re in the midst of another surge, when COVID-19 is now endemic and we’re just stuck with it because we live in idiocracy, I’m not angry. I’m just tired.
0	At this point it’s not even a vaccine but a gullibility test
1	Awesome news! The vaccines are going to end this pandemic soon.
1	Ay finally I can prove to my mom why vaccines are important
1	Back in my day, we didn't have vaccines. We just died.
0	Based on the CDC's own numbers, the areas with the highest vaccination rate were the areas with the biggest spike in excess death
0	Based on the history of COVID shots, who would be so stupid to take a shot and take the risk of the side effects that we’ve seen (too many to list) and get your natural immunity.
0	Basically fucks you up for life.
1	Be aware of the important role of vaccination, it can save your life
0	Before the vaccines I did not know anyone with covid. After the vaccines everyone seemed to have it. I saw a connection and still do. Never known so many sick people about since these vaccines.
1	Being born to an anti vaccine mom is like being spawn killed
1	Believe in vaccines
0	Best decision of our lives not taking that garbage
1	Best explanation I have seen so far on vaccines. My goodness. This should be shown everywhere.
0	Best part of that whole thing was now I ask girls if they are unvaccinated and that’s an instant green flag in my dating world because we have something in common lol.
1	Best thing you can do for yourself is get the one that’s available to you at the earliest and don’t wait. that’s gonna do worlds better than trying to compare them or waiting.
1	Best vaccine is the one that’s available to you first
0	Big Pharma is a bigger threat than the covid virus!
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown.
0	Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs.
0	Biggest waste of money in human history
1	Biontech and curevac basicly startet the mrna thing and, after they cured covid, they could also find a cure for cancer with this technology. Very promising.
1	Block the boneheads. Have had all the vaccines. Had Covid last month. Barely sick. Hardest part was quarantining over the holidays. Thanks to the vaxs and free Covid tests to monitor my safety around others.
0	Blood clots, nervous system attacks, stroke, bells palsy just to name a few. My vax sibling got the clots and palsy...it's been 6 months and she's still suffering. My elderly father also got bells palsy from the vx...going on 8 months for him.
1	Boohoo, I got the covid vaccine and am fine
1	Boom! What a fantastic achievement by researchers, scientists, AI and ML professionals and field professionals! Just a colossal achievement!
1	Booster shots are extremely effective at protecting against serious illness and hospitalization from COVID. Vaccines work!
1	Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important parts of COVID-19 disease that experts are trying to learn more about, and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.
1	Both of my grandparents got theirs and no reported issues. My grandma got hers about a month ago now and only said there was a little pain in her arm but they is 100% normal. The rest of my family is getting it Monday :)
1	Breaks my heart watching this now. I have multiple immunocompromised friends and family. March 2020, my best friend, who got a BS in biomedical engineering, went home to her extremely conservative, small church, homeschooled family. A few months later, she was unmasked, unvaccinated, at large gatherings, after traveling outside of the country. I called her on it, and encouraged her to get it not for her, but for her younger siblings. She accused me of saying she didn't care about her family. That was the last time we talked. After four years of being inseparable, my friend group fell apart out of fears for our own health and safety and those for our families.
1	Bring it on so we can live again
0	Bro. The vaccine side effects are the virus symptoms? Whats goin on there?
0	But if the vaccine worked, even the old shouldn't be dying. In fact, the whole point of the vaccination warning was mostly for the vulnerable old people. The old people were ALWAYS the ones who died at the higher rate, even before we had a vaccine, and we see now that that is STILL the case.
0	But my opinion. ...vaccine against covid19 is not safe
0	But they have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already. Something is not right
0	But we were informed. From day 1 this was untested emergency authorization. That's why I never got it.
0	By not taking the vax. I prolonged my life by 50 years
1	CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate.

0	Call tonight from best friend who's relative (age 54) was found dead on the porch this morning after walking the dogs. He had his first Covid vaccine shot yesterday. He had long term MS but received a healthy report from the Dr. last week. Everyone in shock.
1	Can help to improve immunity
1	Can we all agree that science deniers eating cattle dewormer while accusing everyone else of being a sheep is freaking hilarious?
1	Can't wait for my parents to get vaccinated.
1	Can't wait for the day when the covid 19 vaccine is widely available to everyone.
0	Can't wait to see how this vax reacts with the next round of engineered covid.
0	Canadian here. Always say no to 1984. The idea that the unvaccinated are a risk to anyone other than themselves is moronic.
1	Can’t wait until my son can get it.
1	China vaccines good
1	Co-worker was hung up on vaccine side-effects even though her doctors and some co-workers (me included) said it was nothing and Covid itself is worse. ICU for her.
0	Congratulations, or rest in peace
1	Considering we just spent the last 3 days in the hospital with my 8 month old who needed oxygen support from a respiratory infection, I’m getting my booster this week. Let’s remember the ones who can’t and are the most vulnerable.
1	Cooking at home or taking a bath is more dangerous than having the vaccine. Less than 1 in a million side effects!
0	Covid and the mask isn’t the problem. It’s the vaccine.
0	Covid is a strange pandemic followed by an even stranger vaccine. Heavily vaccinated countries have more excess deaths, post the rollout of the vaccine, than they did during the pandemic (without the vaccine). Go figure.
1	Covid is serious and death is not its only serious outcome! No one should get Covid deliberately!! Our safest way out of this are the vaccines so go get vaccinated people!!
0	Covid passport was a conspiracy theory 11 months ago . Now look
0	Covid wont hurt you but the needles will
1	Covid-19 vaccination reduces the burden on healthcare systems by lowering the number of severe cases and hospitalizations and thus allows medical resources to be allocated more efficiently and effectively.
1	Covid-19 vaccines saved an estimated 20m lives during their first year
1	Coworker got COVID four months ago and has been coughing ever since. Fuck that, I’m getting a vaccine!
1	Crazy how some people believe the links their friends post on Facebook more than doctors who have studied medicine for years.

0	DON’T DO IT! Well, it is your choice but don’t tell me to do it!
1	Day 11 on Moderna and I feel fine. Just had sore arm the day after I got it.
1	Day 12 on moderna no side affects so far I feel good
1	Day two with Covid, I feel like I've been hit by a double decker bus. If this is what it's like after three jabs I can only imagine what it would be like for the unvaccinated! Get your vaccines people!
0	Definitely not taking this poison
1	Delta would have been extremely ugly without a vaccine or if it had been the first pandemic strain.
1	Did you not read the article. It said vaccine is good
0	Didnt even need the first shot. It has been proven to be ineffective
0	Do another video about how it gives you fatal conditions like myocarditis please. I'm super interested in the topic of the vaccine doing more harm than good and I would like to know why this video is up still because of that :) Seems like you are contributing to people's sickness which could get you into legal trouble I would hope.
0	Do not believe COVID is a threat
0	Do not give your kids this injection!!
0	Do not take the vaccine, do I repeat myself ,DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE!!!!
0	Do not take the vaccine. If they make you take it, fight for your life and go to WAR
0	Do these vaccines prevent Covid19
1	Do your own research. Everyone that I know who got it died. Some 2 or 3 times. One guy has even died 7 times and is on the verge of dying again.
1	Do y’all ever just exist to flex on anti-vaxxers?
0	Doctor says: The Patten number for the covid vaccine is 060606. Sheep person: Says nothing strange about that I’ll take it give me three.
1	Doctors are saying that COVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way.
0	Doctors said it didn't impact periods. They lied.

0	Don't do it. It's dangerous.
0	Don't get the vaccine
0	Don't let the government infect you're cells with RNA. You're natural immune system is all you or anyone needs! Believe in nature and yourself!
0	Don't take poisons. Don't take experimental medicines unless you are willing to be experimented on.
0	Don't take the vaccine. I took it and it was a big mistake. the day after i got the vaccine i started to black out, get dizzy, I also got fever, nausea, and i got bad diarrhea. My school had to quarantine me for 12 days and the same thing happened to 2 of my friends.
0	Don't take vaccines. Just pray
1	Don't trust science? Don't go to the hospital then.
0	Don't trust the vaccine . My choice .
0	Don't trust these "vaccines".
1	Dont listen to these anti-vaxxers, i am great full for the vaccine and the protection it provides. I just got my 4th pfizer booster 3 months ago, just a 24 hour fever and mild chest pain and heart fluttering. Recently got covid but it was mild thanks to the vaccine.
0	Dont take the poison
0	Don’t become their GUINEA PIG to see if you live or die!
0	Don’t search for the truth on social media or websites basically. Just obey and get the shot. No thank you
1	Dr. Mike….I’m 57 and I am 100% pro-vax….I am doing it for myself AND I live with my 92 yr old mom at home of which I act as a caregiver for her.
1	Dr. Sahin & Dr. Türeci who came up with this mRNA synthesis solution and who‘ve provided their help are real geniuses. This is incredible
0	Dude how can they require a vaccine that even isn't fda approved? I dropped my program for that very reason
0	Dude if they make a "vaccine" less than a year then you know somethings up.
1	Due to thses successful vaccination campaigns my trust in the scientific and medical communities has increased a lot.
1	Dying from a preventable disease. I mean, I honestly don’t feel sorry for people like this
0	EVERYONE should be refusing to be a guinea pig in this eugenics experiment
0	Eat healthy take care of your immune systems then you won’t need vaccines love your body and yourself.
0	Ehhhh no thanks.
0	Even if I die, i will never regret NOT getting the shots. because i didnt get them…OUT OF LOVE
0	Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
1	Every child has the right to get preventive vaccines!!
0	Every death is significant!!!!! Someone’s family member has died due to this POISON!!!! This is experimental gene therapy!!!!
0	Every drug has side effects
1	Every person who chooses not to be vaccinated at this point needs to sign a waiver that they will incur all medical expenses and not place the burden on all of society/insurance companies/etc...if the patient should pass away these expenses would then fall on their beneficiary and any life insurance/401K/ or other investments that they had saved for. At this point it is ridiculous to not believe in the seriousness of this virus(es).
0	Every time I hear a "get your shot" spot on the radio it makes me angry. It's on all the stations. Never once a word about any problems with them.
0	Every time i watch a video like this i get a surge of energy knowing i kept my backbone and not once considered the silly jab. Theres power in doing what you know is right and not being bullied, bribed, blackmailed, scared, guilt tripped, brainwashed into doing something you dont want to do.
1	Every. Fucking. Time. COVID is fake-> positive COVID test is fake because doctors are getting kickbacks-> I won’t get vaccinated because they’re trying to control us-> doctors are killing us in the hospitals and saying it was COVID-> ad nauseum. The common denominator in ALL of these is their inability to admit they were wrong. Period. They spend their time arguing with others and tell them why they are wrong because (to them) being wrong means you are weak. So they can’t possibly admit they were wrong.
1	Everybody I talk to about this in my area is in the "whatever" camp, which infuriates me. Yeah, whatever if you get it, but what about when you visit your parents/grandparents/coworkers, then they get infected and it spreads further?
1	Everybody, finishing something quickly doesn't mean it is rushed
0	Everyone is seeing how ineffective this vaccine is so now they have to find another excuse to try to force it on us
1	Everyone should do all they can to keep the anti vaccers from getting the shot!! Its a gift to clean the idiots from society
1	Everyone should take the vaccine Even the anti-vaccine people
0	Everyone’s getting sick from all the jabs!!!
1	Exact same side effects as every other vaccine, people are just always scared of the unknown.
1	Excellent video I hope everyone understood about the efficacy of vaccines
1	Excellent video explains the myth that blanketed many who are against or doubt of getting the vaccination.
0	Expect cancer , infertility and other illnesses to sky rocket , now , in the short term and long term ,
0	Experimental! GOOD LUCK! but we are goooood! no Vaxx here thank you!, I'll pick getting infected let's gooooo
0	Explain why you get a sore throat from the vaccine and all the symptoms of having the virus. That can only happen if it is invading cells!
1	FUCK YEAH!!! My family and I were able to get our first doses yesterday! Happy to be part of this statistic!!!
1	Failing to vaccinate your kids is akin to child abuse.
0	First let me say forget about the"vaccine". Not taking it. I went thru the whole year as a essential worker. Sometimes didn't wear a mask. No virus. The government is doing something shady I just don't know what it is but miss me with this BS vaccine
0	First the FDA advocated on behalf of Pfizer to keep the clinical trial data hidden for 75 years and now they refuse to release the raw data. Now what could be in that data important enough to want to hide it?
1	Flu vaccines regularly have 40-60% efficacy, considered to be good. Anything that is 60% - 90% efficacy is 'simply the best'
0	Folks, it’s really simple. Don’t let anyone with zero liability stick an experimental substance that has a terrible track record with animals into your body. This is DUH 101.
1	For anyone wondering, the vaccines are perfectly safe. I got mine today and didn’t immediately die. My mom also got her’s a week before mine and she’s fine
1	For expectant mothers like me who receive the COVID-19 vaccine create antibodies to the virus and pass those to their unborn baby through the placenta.
0	For someone not obese, sick or elderly the jab is medically unnecessary and a greater risk than the lab-engineered and patented bug.
0	For this vaccine human are the rats,
0	For those actually fighting for the last little bit of freedom we have left, stay strong!!!
1	For those on the fence, it’s time to protect yourself and others; please get vaccinated.
0	Forcing healthy people to take medicine they don't need is a crime.
1	Fortunately, I felt fine after my first shot recently
1	Fortunately, I felt fine after my first shot recently, but my upper arm ( where I got the shot) got pretty sore about 8 hrs after the shot, but I'm doing well, I presently feel no ill affects
1	Fortunately, a vaccine for Covid-19 has also been produced. That means all activities will be returned to its orbit and happy life lies ahead.
0	Friend of Mine died of corona march 1 although He was Vaccinated 3 tomes
1	From my experience vaccinated individuals are less likely to spread the virus to others, contributing to a decrease in overall transmission rates. This is crucial for controlling the spread of the virus and preventing outbreaks.
1	From the reliable sources I came to know that vaccination plays a vital role in restoring economic stability by allowing businesses to operate more safely and reducing the need for widespread lockdowns and restrictions.
1	Fuck that. I’ll get a shot a week if it keeps me from getting that wretched virus.
0	Fuck the Vaccine
1	Fully vaccinated and I still wear a mask. Not really sure why people stopped wearing them. The vaccine isn't just about personal safety it's about the safety of others.
1	Fully vaccinated and feel great
1	Fully vaccinated!!! Suck it COVID!!!
1	Fully vaxed and relaxed
1	Fully vaxxed as of last week since i quit my old job and joined a hospital in late Feb. GF just got her first shot too through our vaccine-share program that is constantly filled up. For the first time in a longtime I've started to feel hopeful.
1	Fully vaxxed as of today! Such a relief.
1	Fully vaxxed no regrets
0	Fun fact: Im unvaccinated and healthy.
0	Funny how so many of these people did put their lives on the line just to prove how safe the vaccine was until they literally gave their lives for a useless no good poison that’s destroyed so many lives. I couldn’t put my life on theline for something I’mnot sure of
0	Funny how they say they still don’t know everything about the virus yet they claim to know everything about the safety of the vaccines.
1	Funny that all those people that are scared of the vaccine, drive their car, cooking, take medicine every day.. Each of these have higher odds of dying than the 1 in 10 million of the vaccine (Astra only)
0	GUYS DO NOT GET IT THATS JUST TOXIC WASTE
1	Get any vaccine you can at the first opportunity you can. The benefits outweigh any side effects
0	Get the vaccine and you are guaranteed to look like the toxic crusader in a few years
1	Get the vaccine as soon as possible.
1	Get vaccinated it might save your life
1	Get vaccinated!
1	Get vaccinated! The life you save might be your own.
1	Get your vaccines, it's better than being dead.
1	Getting mine in a week and I'm so stoked
1	Getting my first dose in a few hours, I'm glad this pandemic will be over soon
1	Getting my first shot in about ten minutes
1	Getting my first vaccine tomorrow. This helped out my mind at ease a bit.
1	Getting my first vaccine tomorrow. This helped put my mind at ease a bit.
1	Getting my second Pfizer shot next week. Cant wait!
1	Getting my second shot of Pfizer on April 14th! Only side effect was soreness in my arm. Off to visit my parents in May who have also both been vaccinated. Amazing job Pfizer and BioNTech! Hope they start implementing vaccine passports to keep the people who are afraid of the shot at home.
1	Getting vaccinated is necessary
1	Getting vaccinated, wearing a mask, sanitising your hands etc is not “living in fear”. It’s called “taking due precautions” and it’s the most rational way to live right now.
0	Giving people this vacchine is a crime
0	Glad I didn't get any of them
1	Glad my Wife, Children, and I got the vaccine. My youngest is immunocompromised and has been exposed to covid at school multiple times and even by my brother in law who has no regard for others. None of us have gotten it, that I know of.
1	Glad they can be vaccinated. Wish availability of vaccine vastly improves so all who want a vaccine can get one.
1	Glad to see many people from infants to adults get the benefits of protection from vaccine.
1	Glad to see that companies still put some value on research and didn't get pushed into releasing untested stuff the way some politicians imagined they would
1	Go get your vaccine bro, the time is a minor factor
0	God bless all those who have challenged and refused to comply based on realistic evidence and not media fuelled fear.
0	God bless them. That jab is literally poison!
0	God’s intelligence is far superior. Our body is a self healer with right diet and environment. Our body is our doctor. Vaccines is designed to depopulate the world. Herbs are created for us to treat our illness by that supreme being. Please try to understand that we are being controlled. It’s all business. Money making.
0	Good luck to all of you who took any of these-vaccines- however I refuse to take any vaccine for this 95 percent exaggerated illness as mainly I feel it is anti-Biblical.
0	Good luck with that!! No to Covid vaccine
1	Good news because the pace of vaccination needs to pick up soon. Two million a day in the U.S. should be the floor.
1	Good news!
1	Good stuff! I experienced no symptoms except a sore arm. My brother did get a mild sickness after his second shot. The vaccine prompts an immune response, so that is in fact perfectly normal. I've gone a few months not wearing a mask in public and even went to a large event with hundreds of people, also maskless and have yet to get sick! it definitely does work considering how extremely contagious the virus is, and me not getting sick. The place where I get my hair cut, I asked and they also have stopped wearing masks and no one has gotten sick yet. That was proof to me that even the masks definitely work to help prevent catching it: Being so close to so many people cutting their hair for the entire pandemic. I asked and was told no one had gotten sick. This was before the vaccine when everyone was wearing masks.
1	Good work WHO. I had all my COVID-19 vaccines including the booster. No side effects. My little girl want to become President of WHO in the near future.
1	Good. I'm glad a vaccine has been determined to be safe and effective enough to be made available for anyone in the public who chooses to take it. If this helps some people reach a decision to opt to receive the vaccine and thereby ends up saving a few lives, then it is a good thing.
1	Goodness I'm so happy you made this video!! The amount of anti-maskers and anti-vaxers is increasing and its so disappointing! Spreading right info and educating the general public is more important than ever! So thank you for this!
1	Got AZ last week. So far everything is great. Had a sore arm for two days and a brief fever which lasted only 1 hour. I actually feel lucky to have some side effect symptoms as it means the vaccine is training my immune system.
1	Got all my shots. Never got covid and feel great. I know i can still get it but my body will be able to fight it better. God is good
1	Got both of the vaccine doses, first time had a small fever, second time only a sore arm and felt lightheaded. Other than that I'm perfectly fine and suggest everyone to do it.
1	Got fully vaccinated today, so I performed my "Civic Duty" as the "New World Order Government" claims it to be.
1	Got mine and a flu vaccine just this last Saturday. There really isn't any reason not to, unless you just physically or medically can't.
1	Got mine in maryland usa yesterday. Sore arm and a little fatigue but 1000% worth it.
1	Got mine today! So stoked.
1	Got my 2nd dose of moderna Thursday. No side effects!
1	Got my 4 shots. No problem. Grandsons got their shots too and am glad they did. They need the protection.
1	Got my COVID 19 shot yesterday just wanted to learn how vaccines work
1	Got my Oxford AZ vaccine on Friday. Easy. Slight fever for 24 hours and that’s it. Same with my 85 year old granny. I’m 24. Safe for all ages. Go get it! My confidence has grown a lot. We are almost there!!✌🏻
1	Got my Pfizer vaccine 1st dose today, about 8 hours ago. Feels about the same as a flu shot. Shoulder a bit sore, a bit fatigued. I think after a good nights sleep tonight I'll be fine.
1	Got my first Pfizer first dose and feeling good. Can’t wait for the second dose.
1	Got my first dose a week ago and looking forward to #2!
1	Got my first dose of Pfizer today. I was not ready for the atmosphere. Everyone was just so UP and excited and happy. It was the most fun I’ve had with strangers in over a year.
1	Got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning! So incredibly happy about it! Experiencing nothing but a sore arm.
1	Got my first dose today (Moderna) my right arm is very sore but nothing I can't handle. Im looking forward to the second dose lets end this nightmare!
1	Got my first dose today! Was really excited! I see a lot of people online getting dressed up to get the vaccine - and maybe that would help some who are hesitant. Make it fun, a celebration, and take pictures! Whatever helps you get the vaccine!
1	Got my first dose yesterday, my arm hurts, but I'm glad it's my arm and not my lungs
1	Got my first moderna vaccine today. Health department texted at 1pm went right over to the site and was done by 2 pm. No way was I not going to get this shot.
1	Got my second Moderna vaccine on Saturday. Sunday and Monday I felt like shit. Like a flu or bad cold. You should 100% get your vaccine, but just beware and prepare. Everybody I know who got the second one got at least a little bit sick and some had over 101 temperature.
1	Got my second Pfizer jab yesterday.... feeling ok just some soreness on the arm...please go get vaccinated
1	Got my second dose on Wednesday! My arm is achey but nothing a couple tylenol can’t fix and in a few short weeks I’ll have peace of mind that’s been missing from my life since last February
1	Got my second dose today, wish me luck! And congrats to everyone who is fully vaccinated
1	Got my second shot of moderna two days ago! Feel perfectly fine! In fact I feel better than after the first shot where I just had some deltoid tenderness. Now I feel normal!
1	Got my second shot this week, had one day of sickness but nothing bad at all. Hoping everyone everywhere can be eligible and have access asap! Please get scheduled if you can, you never know whose life you might save by doing so.
1	Got my shot thanks to Wisconsin's Save the Fatties program.
1	Got my shot today and I feel great! Thank you!
1	Got the Pfizer a month ago. Second dose makes you feel weak, but it's all worth it. I'm vaccinated
1	Got two, live in FL. Will be getting the new ones, it greatly helped lessen the severity of COVID.
1	Got vaccinated today, feeling good :)
1	Got vaccinated with sinovac from China last week. So far no side effects. I even went to the gym 3 hours after i got vaccinated
0	Government: don’t worry it’s your choice to get the vaccine! Also government: we will limit your rights and restrict your freedoms because you didn’t get the vaccine your now second class citizens.
0	Governments cannot protect you. Your God given immune system CAN!
1	Grateful and thankful, that we live in a time, where we can get these vaccines and lives, can be saved. Most “Third World Countries”, take a looonger time in getting these vaccines, but eventually, they do. Thanks to ALL the Scientists, Doctors, Distributors, etc, who make things possible. WHO, you have made a huuuuge difference in Africa, since I was a child…thank you.
1	Grateful for all my Covid vaccines and flu vaccine.... Trying my best to stay well...
1	Great job! Thanks for this video, very useful and help people to understand the vaccine clearly! Go and get vaccinated !
1	Great news. Fantastic work by those involved in creating this vaccine, so thankful to them.
0	Great way of bringing in tracking and surveillance of people
1	Great! Normalcy can't come soon enough, but we are almost there.
0	HOW ARE PEOPLE STILL FALLING FOR THIS
1	Had Covid-19. Got two vaccines and booster. I’m very grateful to research scientists, doctors and the dedicated medical world.
0	Had it twice and still wouldn't get me or my kids vaccinated .. and here we are still living life like normal
1	Had my first AZ shot 5 days ago and so far it has been a non event....not even a sore arm....
1	Had my second dose a week ago. I'm so relieved to have gotten it, as I see the death toll and permanent injuries rising due to this disease. Wear your mask, wash your hands, social distance, and get vaccinated! That is how we will defeat COVID.
1	Had my second dose the other day. Felt rough the day after (tiredness, etc) but not as bad as a flu jab!
0	Had the shots and COVID. The last two shots made me feel like I was gonna die. The COVID wasn't all that bad compared to them.
1	Had the vaccine yesterday feel great nothing but a sore and swollen arm
0	Had the vaccines and ended up in the hospital with Covid. Still have no taste or smell since I got Covid December 2022 and now have lung problems and other long term effects.
0	Happy new year everyone I’m glad there are a community of people that is against this shot!!
1	Happy tears ! Got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine today. The only reaction it gave was JOY !#CovidVaccine
0	Harmful substance in vaccine
1	Have already been vaccinated “ and I hope covid-19 stay away forever
0	Haven’t we know about myocarditis being an adverse event associated with the Covid vaccine for a long time? How many more studies do we need? When is someone with the power to do something going to do something?
0	He isn't concerned. Tell that to the family of those who died from the shot. My daughters customer said her mother ended up in ICU after the 2nd shot.
0	He said "it looks safe" ok you've convinced me. You take it and ill see how you are in 5 years.
0	Hell no I will not take it
0	Hell no, I'm not getting the vaccine. The only person I know that got it died three days after their 2nd vaccination!
0	Hell no... no vaccine
1	Hello here in Australia, I have had part 1 of the AstraZeneca in April and and scheduled for part 2 in July. I have not had any issues at all.
1	Here in the UK, young people can't get our vaccines yet and we're still having supply issues, but as soon as I can get vaccinated I will be getting mine!
1	Hey cinco de mayo for my second shot too! High five! But I'm not going out to celebrate right away, I'm planning to take a week off for memorial day week and travel somewhere!
0	Higher risk for young children and the elderly
1	Highly recommended for those 6 months and above and pin cushions.
0	Him: You have a less likely chance to have a allergic reaction then to be struck by lightning. Me: broski my mom sister and grandma all had allergic reactions to it varying in reactions but still was bad.
1	Honestly It’s Perfectly safe
1	Honestly it's a shame that people are more worried about their kid having or developing autism as opposed to their kid possibly dying from not being vaccinated.
1	Honestly not taking the vaccine is irresponsible because it puts others in danger. People who refuse the vaccine because it is “too new” and “dangerous” are 1) wrong because the newest vaccines are similar to old vaccines proven to work, just specific to covid strains, and 2) selfish for putting their own standards above the livelihood and health of others.
1	Honestly, i was picky at first with vaccines hoping to get pfizer or moderna. But after watching this video, I realized the best vaccine is what’s available to you at that moment. Regardless, it’s still a vaccine hence why i got vaccinated with sinovac today :))
1	Hope everything go right and we get vaccine as early as possible
1	Hope he got the vaccine. Either way thank you to him for furthering science!
0	Hopefully more and more people will refuse the jab and scupper their plans to alter humanity and derail their evil agenda.
0	How about ....No. not in 2020, Not ever. They can shove them where the sun dont shine
0	How about NOT getting vaxxed and living normally. That way you don’t have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks or Bell’s Palsy ☺️
0	How about we start with bels palsy or violent seizures. Or my favorite death. Take this vaccine at your own risk!!!
0	How can this lot still push the vaccines with a smile on their face.
0	How convenient for the vaccine companies
0	How do these people sleep at night ? Majority of people didn’t want them, that is why the rate in Australia started slowing down around the 35% mark and then started stripping rights away and started mandating it to work in the health system now you have to be jabbed to work anywhere and you can’t even go into most shops and now we are at 85% 🤔
0	How do we know the shot is working? Survival rate goes from 99.6% to 99.8%?
1	How do we say thank you to the health workers and scientists for their sacrifice and service? Receive the vaccine as soon as one can to lessen their load and keep wearing a mask to protect fellow citizens. In my 80th year, I am grateful and hopeful for better days ahead.
0	How is it possible that nowadays, after all the "vaccine" damages and even deaths coming forward, those "scientist" still claim the so-called "vaccines" are safe and effective. Unbelievable!
0	How naive the world is, this isn’t a vaccine
1	Huge news to get vaccine to the masses. We’re going to have a great summer America! Hope you’ve been working on that beach bod during quarantine
1	Huh, almost as if the vaccines work. Weird. Get your damn shots people.
0	Hundreds have died from taking the vaccine.
1	I 'll got my 1st shot of Moderna vaccine but the side effect that I received was swollen of arm and pained where the shot injected.Accrdg to observation area in vaccination facility you might put cold compress on the area,its really working..Remembered we need to followed the instruction of healthcare professionals in order to achieved vaccine immunity against Covid ..
0	I DON'T take vaccines so I never took any of the Covid-19 Vaccines and, today it is January 3rd, 2024 and I've NEVER got Covid!
1	I JUST WANT TO END THIS, THE VACCINE IS THE THING THAT I WANT FROM THE START
0	I REALLY DON'T GIVE A SHIT I WILL NEVER TAKE ANY OF THIS IT WAS PRODUCED TO FAST
1	I Will Get The Vaccine
1	I already was able to get a 4th injection ( second booster). In Australia, all over 65 , and immunised suppressed are advised to have a 4th, and all over 30 years have an option to do so.
1	I also got the vaccine, Moderna, and 5 days after I felt some inflammation in my axillary lymph nodes. Which suggests that I am forming an immunity, but just something that I wanted to share since it was pretty noticeable. I also had soreness of the injection site but other than that nothing else.
1	I also work in healthcare, I am proud to be a Caregiver and yes if I can get the vaccine I will. The well being of my Family and my clients are number one.
1	I always wondered what happened to all the antivaxers who were convinced we would all be dead from a delayed response to the vaccine by now. What are they telling themselves now?
0	I am 68 years old, not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy.
1	I am 80 and my wife is 77 and we took the Moderna vaccine and had no side effects on either shot.
1	I am a UCLA retiree and I still can’t even get my first vaccine because I cannot find any appointments
1	I am a doctor in the U.K. I had the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. The benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks! All vaccines will have some degree of risk. The most important thing about vaccination is that it will significantly reduce the chances of you dying or ending up on a ventilator regardless of which vaccine you have!
0	I am a double organ transplant recipient with a compromised immune system. My transplant Dr. said absolutely no! Not nearly enough tests or results available yet.
0	I am against a vaccine for Covid! It has a massive survival rate 99.777%! Eat clean and exercise I’m not taking a vaccine for Covid
1	I am extremely happy that I have had 3 shots for COVID-19, a flu shot & a shingles shot. I feel wonderful, no flu, no headaches, no nothing. I agree, Go Get Vaccinated Now.
1	I am fully vaccinated and was fine second dose just soreness
0	I am healthier with the GOD given immune system HE gave me.. I will take my chances.. No vaccine for me..
0	I am not doing the vaccine, thank you.
0	I am not getting it because I don't want to die
0	I am not getting the vaccine. Half the people I talked to had side effects. I am not trading one risk for another. It’s my body.
0	I am not going to become an experimentation subject for the global mRNA testing. Even if they pay me to do it . I can't be sure that it doesn't touch the DNA and also i find it useless.
0	I am not going to get the vaccine
0	I am not that much sure about the effectiveness of the vaccine
0	I am not vaccinated and I’m still alive.
1	I am planning to take one of these vaccines I believe they are going to make a difference I have no intention of wanting to be locked in doors to stay safe. Bring it on
1	I am pro-vaccine despite having two very bad reactions to two AZ vaccines. Lost months and spent a lot of time in hospital. Just had a booster and support vaccines against COVID. I was just unlucky.
1	I am so appreciative of this video, thank you very much for this much needed information, it is balanced and accurate and fair information, we need more Dr's to speak about the real effectiveness and information regarding the vaccine....there is way too much fear mongering and misleading info on other sites
0	I am so glad you’re talking about this openly and honestly. I am so sick of everybody shoving everything under the carpet and thinking these vaccines are life-saving!
1	I am so lucky to have been vaccinated and not have to worry so much. There are still so many things to do in life.
0	I am still injured from my 1st.
0	I am surprised they give you a choice in the military! However, I ain't taking that thing!
0	I am unvaccinated and I finally contracted Covid last week but it only lingered and kept me down for one day and I was back on my feet but I am staying isolated in the meantime just to play it safe and not get anyone else sick. All my friends and family that got vaccinated have had it 4 to 5 times hospitalized horribly and the recovery was into the months. I’m unvaccinated and that’s OK
0	I am very much worried about the side effects of COVID vaccine
0	I am victim of vaccine too and covid infection. Both dont work well on me. My immune system has started to behave crazy.This has been a mess so far. I jave taken so many other vaccines before and never had such reactions. Have been perfectly healthy before. I feel so let down by govt , doctors etc. I have lost trust on people in general now
0	I applaud his firm stance. His body, his choice.
1	I believe tha the quickest way for life to return to normal is for most children to get vaccinated
1	I believe the shots work and will definitely get the new shot which covers more strains when it comes out.
1	I believe vaccine very much and I'm in UAE here it's compulsory including each 13 day pcr test otherwise we cannot go anywhere except own Room and i love this rule thankful to UAE government
0	I believe you were very well paid, by big pharma. Make a video on post vaccinated monitored immune system: to let US know how protected are they and for how long. Make another vídeo about the injuries and side effects of people who took the vaccine. Include the dead ones too. And try not to blame it on Covid Once every body knows that the majority of population is now vaccinated and most Covid cases are happen within the vaccinated population.
1	I came to know that for optimal protection, it is important to receive the recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses.
1	I can imagine how agonizing it is for the healthcare providers who treat this man and thousands like him to know that he would likely not be on the verge of death if he had just gotten the vaccine
1	I can't believe it has become controversial to say it, especially among "conservatives," but I believe in science. I trust American scientists. I believe in vaccines.
1	I can't believe it has become controversial to say it, especially among "conservatives," but I believe in science. I trust American scientists. I believe in vaccines. #GetVaccinated
0	I can't believe it's 2024 and people are still defending the covid vaccine / boosters for young adults lol
0	I can't believe they can give us this info like it's completely fine wow!
1	I can't get over the irony of Texans dying on the hill of "personal freedom" but God forbid a woman decides to have a choice about her reproductive health.
1	I can't wait for my second shot in 4 weeks!
1	I can't wait to get mine. Unfortunately my special Premier and his cabinet members who were all traveling abroad for Xmas (on Dec 13th they put a traveling ban both for cross provinces and international borders) are deemed more important than me and the majority of the population, so I have to wait.
1	I can't wait to get the vaccine! I am at risk and haven't left my home in a year. After I get it I'm going to double-mask and get a hair cut :)
0	I canceled my booster yesterday.
0	I cannot trust a vaccine produced this quick. So many steps skipped
1	I cannot understand why so many people don't wan to get the vaccine, I can understand it in some circumstances, but I believe that that is the underground scenario
0	I cannot wait to get my 10th booster this year so I can still catch and spread covid. I might even get lucky and get myocarditis and blood clots like thousands of others that injected this 100% safe and effective medical miracle.
1	I cannot wait to get my covid vaccine while I wear my sawbones vaccines shirt
1	I cant wait to receive my vaccine.
1	I can’t wait till me and my family are vaccinated. That way I don’t have to worry about the anti science dumb asses messing anything up for us anymore. Fuck these stupid ass people.
1	I can’t wait to get mine!
0	I can’t wait to never get any of those vaccines
1	I caught covid recently & it was super mild. I thank being vaccinated. I didn't even think I was sick until I took a test. However, my redneck nieces and nephews refuse the vaccine, and it's been brutal for them. No sympathy from me.
0	I could name 25 people that I knew that was very very very very very healthy including my mom my sister-in-law and friends that died after taking these shots
1	I did have side effects that included breathing, living, enjoying life, not spreading the virus to others, not getting the virus, and the like.
1	I did not have a "medical professional" advise me to get or not get the vaccination....I read the chart, and since I am over 65, and have some of the health issues, I signed up. No one said anything to me at either of the injection sites about whether I should get the shot or not. People have to use their own judgement and common sense about what to do...."medical professionals" all have different opinions.!!
0	I did not take the shot and when I learned what it was, I am glad I didn't
0	I did not want the shots but was forced as a nurse. Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it.
0	I didn't needed that i already have a good immune system
0	I do NOT plan on taking these EXPERIMENTAL vaccinations! Even now they have to trace you for two years after taking them because the "researchers" do not know what to expect. Frontline doctors and the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons have a better plan!!!
1	I do not regret getting vaccinated. I lost nothing. No after effects except a sore arm that generally comes with all shots/blood sampling.
0	I do not trust anything the government has developed..
0	I don't care how many black nurses, celebrities, or tv doctors get the vaccine I'm not taking it.
0	I don't care what side you're on, just don't force me to take something I don't want to take
1	I don't get it; Why do the people who don't trust the doctors, always go running to those same doctors when they get really sick? Why don't they go to the people who told them that the doctors are wrong?
0	I don't know anyone eager to trust a new injection with no long term testing. The scientific community wavered so much on during Covid they didn't exactly inspire confidence in getting something right the first time. I understand that's how science works and that's also why I won't be getting the vaccine
0	I don't know anyone who died from COVID.. I do know, many who had adverse reactions to the jab... Some are now experiencing unexplainable, life changing health issues…
0	I don't need it and if anyone tries to force it on me, i'll be really angry.....
0	I don't plan to get this vaccine rushed out too fast!
0	I don't trust doctors,the medical profession and the vaccine has not been tested long enough.
1	I don't understand why 20 percent of careworkers wont have the vaccine .How can they say they care for their clients if they potentially will bring the infection back .Some are visiting 6 or 7 homes a day .If they dont care enough to have the vaccine they should find another job
0	I dont know one person that wants to take this shot.
0	I dont trust that vaccination at all
0	I dont want to experience the side effects. I dont even get the flu or pneumonia shot.
0	I don’t care what is said, I am not getting the Covid vaccine
1	I don’t feel controlled by government when I wear a mask or get #COVID19Vaccine any more than I do wearing a seatbelt, deciding not to drink & drive or stopping at red light. I am vaccinated bc I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. The common good matters.
0	I don’t fully trust the vaccine yet until a couple months pass
0	I don’t have to do anything I’m not comfortable doing.
0	I don’t know anyone who regrets NOT getting that poison cocktail.
0	I don’t need a flu shot
0	I don’t trust it!
1	I don’t trust trump, but I do trust the vaccine. I’m getting it ASAP.
1	I don’t understand why six people in six million (J&J,) is this much of a concern. Seems like the virus is much more dangerous.
0	I don’t understand why so many people lined up to be test subjects
1	I don’t understand why there are people on here telling others NOT to get vaccinated! You are part of the problem.
1	I feel a sense of solidarity with others who have received the vaccine, knowing we are all contributing to the greater good.
0	I feel bad for those who signed up for the experiment and thought they were given the vaccine when actually they're given a placebo
1	I feel better after the injection
1	I feel for all the doctors and nurses at the moment!! If only more people got vaccinated!! It would be less work for them all!!
1	I feel like I lost brain cells watching these anti vaxxers
1	I feel like listening to any anti-vaxxer is BEYOND frustrating when you are from a third world country, rejecting vaccines comes from their privilege of living in a developed country that we most certainly don't have
1	I feel nothing after both doses Pfizer, just a little bit sore arm for 2 days. Thats all
0	I feel publicity of COVID-19 vaccine is inadequate
1	I feel so relieved that the covid 19 vaccine is here and has been tested for safety and efficacy.
0	I feel that government has approved COVID-19 vaccines without following due procedures.
1	I felt no side-effects after taking AztraZeneca. From the first jab up to the second jab no felling of any side-effect.
1	I felt super crummy right after the 2nd dose and then they where gone and as an ICU nurse that has seen the horrors of the pandemic first hand I’ll take it one million times over
0	I fully agree with Dr. Clancy, I am an Italian teacher damaged by the covid vaccine for 3 years, I have developed chronic inflammation, brain fog and peripheral neurological disorder. I am being treated with an auto blood transfusion with ozone. Thank you both, you are magnificent!!
1	I get J&J and none symptoms at all👍
1	I get every cold/covid shot that offered, you wanna get terribly sick go for it.
1	I get me second tomorrow. I can’t explain the feeling of freedom (2 weeks later, I know, but nice to have it over with).
1	I get my second on May 11th and my kids CANNOT WAIT to get theirs but two of the three are waiting on the 12+ approval. The other is 6 so he has awhile yet. I was so nervous for my first. I have horrible medical anxiety/fear of being allergic to things. Did it anyway.
1	I getting my second Moderna vaccine shot tomorrow
1	I got COVID before the vaccine became available (Spring of 2020). I had heart palpitations and shortness of breath. I got the COVID vaccine in the Spring of 2021. My health problems went away.
1	I got COVID before the vaccine became available. I had heart palpitations and shortness of breath for a long time. I got my COVID vaccine in the Spring of 2021. My health problems went away.
1	I got COVID before the vaccine came out (Spring 2020). I had heart palpitations and shortness of breath. I got vaccinated in the Spring of 2021. My health problems went away.
1	I got COVID before the vaccine came out (Spring of 2020). I had heart palpitations and breathing problems for a long time. The vaccine actually helped me feel better.
0	I got Jabbed AGAINST MY WILL TO KEEP MY JOB
1	I got a shot two times with Biontech/Pfizer, but my husband got one shot of Johnon & Johnson and I was worried about if this was enough to keep him healthy. Now I'm much more confident.
0	I got blod clots from covid shot had to have open heart to remove. I suffered terribly and feel I should be compensated
1	I got both of mine. Very happy about it. It's a weight off my shoulders.
1	I got both shots of the vaccine. Only had a sore arm for 24 hours. Feel fine.
1	I got both yesterday on the same arm. Feel like crap today but i'd rather feel like crap for 1-2 days vs a hefty Hospital bill later.
0	I got covid from my sister who is vaccinated and she had it worse than me. I was barely sick and I'm not vaccinated. I've had colds that were worse.
1	I got covid while waiting to be eligible. it's been 3 years and my senses of taste and smell haven't come all the way back. they may never come back. I'll take all the vaccines and boosters I can get my hands on to not risk more of that shit.
1	I got four COVID vaccines the last two-ish years. Most of my friends has got COVID vaccines, none are dead
1	I got mine Fri.Jan29. I get my 2nd one Feb. 29.
1	I got mine I'm doing fine
1	I got mine last Saturday! No side effects for me.
1	I got mine. I’m a kindergarten teacher. No side effects, no creepy stuff in it. If you are given the opportunity, take it. Try to be as brave and selfless as we are on the front lines in kindergarten.
1	I got my 2 vaccines and I'm terrified of needles. Get vaccinated everyone :)
1	I got my 2nd shot yesterday. No side effects unless you count that I get 5G on a 4G phone now and I have a hankering for human flesh.
1	I got my COVID vaccine today. I feel thankful because not everyone in the world has access to the vaccines easily and this event was extremely well-run. I feel thankful that me and my family will be protected now.
1	I got my Moderna vaccine and now I'm a Wifi Hotspot
1	I got my Pfizer shot yesterday the only problem was my arm is a little stiff but other than that it’s all good.
1	I got my booster vaccine shot today & that’s me #GetVaccinated
1	I got my pfizer vaccine n only had headace n sleeping...
1	I got my second Pfzer vaccine yesterday We're all making history here :)
1	I got my second dose earlier this month. I feel a-okay. 👍🏻
1	I got my second dose yesterday!
1	I got my second injection and once again my only side effect was a sore arm for a couple of days. I used an ice pack on it and that helped.
1	I got my second shot 2.5 weeks ago, so today I was able to go see a friend on her birthday. I haven't been able to do that in 14 months. I'm so excited for small birthday visits this year!
1	I got my second vaccination yesterday, feels good. Arm slightly stiff today and I was a bit itchy after the initial prick, but generally feel fine.
1	I got my shots back in March and I just wanna tell you guys, not everyone has a bad reaction from their second Pfizer shot. I had a sore arm for a few days the first time and the second time only had a sore arm the day of the vaccine. No other sickness. So don’t feel too worried, you might also have little to no reaction too.
1	I got my vaccine today, got the Johnson and Johnson, it was the least painfully vaccine I have ever got, and I am very excited for my city is open 100%
1	I got the AstraZeneca vaccine today and glad that I did
1	I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine 2 months ago and so far I have been filling fine with no problems.
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine and I am very pleased that I did.
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine months ago, literally no side-effects, I ain't gonna support anybody being forced to get it (by the government anyways, if shops wanna do vaccine passports and businesses wanna force their employees to get it, that's their business) but that won't stop me from thinking people who don't are idiots, barring legitimate medical reasons, like immune suppression or allergies to ingredients
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine. Last one is on April 1. So happy! No side effects!
1	I got the covid booster yesterday and feel great!
1	I got the fever and everything. Yet, I would go and take another shot of the vaccine any day. I am eternally grateful to the scientists that spent years and even decades to research all of this. Thank you!
1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccination today. I managed to get it despite being 29 and otherwise in perfect health because I volunteer at my local hospital. Glad to be in the 10% with the vaccine so far.
1	I got the first shot yesterday and feel fine
1	I got the initial vaccine plus the boosters. Going to get the new one this fall.
1	I got the moderna and it was easier than a flu shot. Still glad I watched this video because learning about the en vitro fetal cells being used to develop the J&J vax was really cool. Would definitely like to learn more about how they do that.
1	I got the shot 2 months ago and ever since I got it I've had so much energy I rarely sleep now and I feel like I'm on some kind of speed drug I don't know what the hell's inside of this drug or I should say vaccine but I need to get more booster shots I hope they keep giving them to us because I love the way it's making me feel I used to be lazy not want to do nothing and now it's like I'm just a whole new person I just have that high feeling where I just want to keep going and going I have no pain I love it
1	I got the vaccine already 3 times and I will get it until it’ll be necessary . Same as I did with the other vaccines
1	I got the vaccine and I got covid. I had the vaccine last year. So it's been a year and now I'm 4 days into covid. Sure I got covid but this is probably a different strand and maybe I have less of a struggle because of the vaccine
0	I got the vaccine and ended up with cardiomyopathy. I regret ever getting the vaccine. I wish I could take it back now.
1	I got the vaccine both doses of Moderna and I’m thriving. Stop putting false fears.
1	I got the vaccine today, I figured getting the vaccine and dealing with a few uncomfortable side effects would be better than getting covid and ending up in hospital.
1	I got vaccinated and I'm glad! Time to get back to life now!
1	I got vaccinated because I am not a delusional domestic terrorist.
1	I got vaccinated last week, Moderna. Zero side effects. Second shot in 2 weeks.
1	I got vaccinated with first dose 2 weeks ago and i feel great without side affects, i hope the second dose will be fine
0	I guarantee you..... the people who drop dead shortly After taking the Vaccines.... Would Still be Alive & Well if they did NOT take them
0	I had 3 perfectly healthy active friends die from heart attack shortly after the jabs. Other formerly healthy friends with recent and unexplainable health problems.
1	I had AZ jab with no adverse reactions in both jab.
0	I had a heart attack at age 35 weeks after my second Pfizer shot. I was placed on life support.
0	I had a stroke after getting the shot. My life is ruined... What am I suppose to do now? No attorney will take my case...
1	I had all my shots and never tested positive for covid
1	I had both AstraZeneca 1st mild shakes 2nd no effect . I m fine and happy.
1	I had both Moderna vaccines and the Moderna booster. Nothing but great results. I am 75.
1	I had covid in Nov (3 vaccines & 1 previous infection), this time it was way worse than the first time, it took 1 month to feel better, not feeling 100% myself yet, still tired but the terrible headache is gone.. so the next time a booster might be a good idea!
1	I had excellent experiences when I got both my shots. Very nice people. Barely felt anything when shots administered. Very professional, kind, prompt, thoughtful.
1	I had hoped when I got vaccinated it would be the beginning of the end for this virus. I was immunized, vaccination rates were going up, it seemed like things would finally return to normal. But it's been allowed to stay extant for so long that it's had time to mutate. Now I'm likely going to have to get multiple booster shots just to stay immune because these fuckers are insistent on letting it run rampant. Delta is just the beginning. It'll mutate again and again as long as antivaxxers deliberately sabotage our herd immunity. They are dragging all of us down for their god damned pride. Say hello to our new yearly flu, everyone.
1	I had mine about two months now I don’t have no side effects thank god
1	I had my 2 shot vaccine covid-19...and it feel great, only arm sore,no big deal,...is a good feeling,my body is protective and I feel confident.....huyyyyy
1	I had my first shot of AZ yesterday and experienced headache and muscle pain. But I feel better now.
1	I had my second booster today and, based on the information acquired from your very helpful videos, I asked the vaccinator to aspirate before injecting. I explained why and he was happy to do it. Thanks for all you are doing, keep up the good work.
1	I had my vaccines in the March of 2021 and did my embryo transfer June 2021. I’m now 8 months pregnant. And got my booster shot a few months ago. So far no complications
0	I had never gotten it until my vaccinated son got it and gave it to me
1	I had the Pfizer vaccination yesterday. Apart from a sore arm, absolutely no side effects after 30 hours.
1	I had the vaccine and the three subsequent boosters. I had zero symptoms. Don’t listen to anti vax people
1	I had the vaccine yesterday and literally watched the microchip enter my arm. Now all I see is Bill Gates and Microsoft Windows, but not Windows 10, the shitty Windows Vista operating software. God, if only I'd listened to the Youtube comment experts!! I'm also autistic now.
1	I hardly got sick when I got Covid! It was the vaccine
0	I have a friend that took his son for shots and overnight the kid changed!! I saw it happen. I know it's true.
1	I have all 6 of my recommended Covid shots, and I finally tested positive for Covid for the first time a few days ago. Thanks to these vaccinations, my illness has only been a very mild dry cough.
1	I have been vaccinated completely.
1	I have had 3 doses so far and I will probably get a 4th dose soon. I’m thinking it’s like the flu vaccine, which you need annually for it to be effective.
1	I have had 3 shots. Scheduled for 4th. Haven't had covid but if I get it I know I won't die.
1	I have had 3 shots. Scheduled for 4th. Haven't had covid but if I get it I know I won't die. LETS GO DARWIN !!!
1	I have had both series of covid Vaccines, I am still alive and well, with no side effects besides my arm is sore from the shot. I'm proud to say I am vaccinated against covid and also the flu.
1	I have had four Covid shots and I feel great.
1	I have had four covid vaccines and not had a reaction to any of them I had major heart surgery five years ago so I think it was a sensible thing too do .Everyone is entitled to their opinion but for me it was the sensible thing to do. and I have managed to stay covid free .
0	I have headaches, ear ringing, and vision loss from phizer and Moderna vaccine jabs, filed a report on the companies website....no response, visited my primary doctor and they just say it can't be true...must be a pre-existing condition, can't sue them because they have government's immunity from prosecution protection......the victims just get ignored and pushed aside and forgotten. Before the jabs, I was perfectly healthy with no headaches, ear ringing, or vision loss (20/20).
0	I have lost three people to the vaccine
0	I have more chance of surviving with Covid than with the Covid vaccine....
0	I have never nor will I ever trust the government. That's one place my faith will never go
1	I have never seen so many people in such a dither about taking a stupid shot. Where were your rantings and ravings when you took the pneumonia shot, the shingles shot, measles shot, pneumonia shot? Now, here's one that stands a very good chance of possibly saving your life and you act like someone's taking your firstborn!!!!! What an EXCELLENT example of how grown, intelligent people are expected to act.
0	I have not been vaccinated and never had Covid. Everyone I know who has been vaccinated has all had it and gotten ill, including my sister (had 4 shots) who has had it 3 times!
0	I have not been “vaccinated” and I have never had COVID
0	I have not received any message through COWIN app. So I have lost faith in the campaign.
0	I have seen first hand the amount of people that drop dead from PEs and Strokes and heart attacks within days to a few months after having the vaccine.. especially this year since the flu and Covid vaccine.. multiple patients and the only thing they have in common is a recent vaccine
0	I have serious concerns about the health industry. They fired all those that refused to push medication they had no idea were safe, and all those that did, are still there.
1	I have stage 4 lung cancer, received my first round of covid-19 vaccine in December. No side effects other than some soreness in the muscle for a few days. I'll be receiving my second dose on the 26th. Just wanted to say thanks for all the informed info!
0	I have thecovid and have the antibody in my system. Why do I need a vaccine
0	I have trouble trusting people who can't figure out if a mask can help, when they tell us, trust us the vaccine is safe.... oh by the way we not responsible when it goes wrong.
0	I have two friends who’s hearts blew up after taking that poison
0	I haven't taken any vaccination ever since it was rolled out.
1	I heard that by achieving widespread vaccination coverage, communities can develop herd immunity, which helps protect those who cannot be vaccinated (due to medical reasons or age) and reduces the overall transmission of the virus.
1	I hope Suptnik V is granted for Emergency Use. ✌✌ https://t.co/KwYgsd5C29
1	I hope l can get mine soon l am 67 and have health conditions been shielded for 4 weeks can’t wait till I can go out again
1	I hope that I get the vaccine because you guys explain it so well
1	I hope the vaccines will save all the people around the world. God bless you all out there
1	I hope these “my body my choice” individuals maintain the same energy when talking about abortions and the bodily autonomy rights of pregnant people.
1	I hope they make it mandatory so all these nut jobs don't ruin it for the rest of us.
0	I hope you've opened your eyes to what they have actually done to us with the vaccine.
0	I just automatically assume people who get the vaccine barely have the IQ to push a broom.
1	I just got 6 vaccines 2 days ago since my parents were pretty anti-vax, now they're just vaccine hesitant. I'm 18 now. I got dTPa, IPV, MMR, Meningococcal ACWY, Hep B (Paed), and HPV. Thanks to Medicare I got all of these completely free, and I'll be completely up to date in 4 months, and they were completely fine apart from both my arms being pretty sore and some brief but mild respiratory symptoms experienced yesterday.
1	I just got mine today 🙌🏼💉🦠 my arm hurts right there on the spot. That means is working 💪🏼
1	I just got my Pfizer biontec vaccine at UNC and I was thrilled to see your information on this to know about the vaccine in my body! Thank you so much!
1	I just got my second dose! My daughter, who is 16, will get her second dose next week. Hubs has had both his and is past his 14 day window. The level of stress relief that comes from having done it is indescribably. Knowing that everyone in my house will be set by mid-May is so freeing. It allows us to plan to meet with other vaxxed friends and to know that when we mask up and go out, our choice has made the world a little safer for everyone.
1	I just got my second pfizer shot yesterday! I have been anxious about side effects but nearly 24 hours later and I haven't felt a thing. I'm so relieved! Excited to get back to living a normal life.
0	I just got over Covid smh thanks Trump for not taking it serious. Now we gotta live with this disease for the rest of our lives mutating smh
1	I just got the COVID-19 vaccine. I implore all those who have the opportunity to get this done. #COVID19
1	I just heard of a guy that was a denier. Caught Covid. Ask the doctor for one of those Miracle drugs that don't work and was denied. Got sicker went out to the store and bought an oxygen meter. Man got hospitalized after that. Didn't want to go because he didn't want them to put him on a vent. The idiots are out there people mask up
0	I just love hearing stories like this. The Vaxxed man Lectures Us on health. That's a good one.
1	I just made my appointment for my first vaccine.
1	I just received my first dose today!
1	I just received the Moderna vaccine yesterday. No side effects except for a slight soreness at the injection site. I wish everybody can watch this video and hopefully everyone can get the vaccine when it’s available for them. We can get rid of this virus together.
1	I just spent an half an hour reading anti vax comments, I have lost faith in humanity.
0	I knew it was safe when they blackmailed people for their jobs
0	I knew no vaccines has been effective anyway. I am not getting one.
1	I know it drives me crazy! These weirdos think taking Vitamins D, C and Zinc is somehow beneficial to their immune systems. Just get the vaccine people!!!
1	I know it sucks, but take it from a survivor, the long term side effects of being moderately sick from COVID is so much worse, one year later still, than a couple days of crappy feeling from getting the vaccine.
1	I know more people who've been vaccinated than people who've had COVID. So happy to see the rollout gaining steam!
0	I know people who died from the vaccine.
0	I know quite a few Black people who aren't going to get the vaccine. I happen to be one of them.
0	I know so many people who had injections and are ill now.
0	I know that manufacturers refuse to vaccinate with their own vaccines
0	I like how you just proved the vaccine is shit
0	I like listening to educated people telling me that the vaccine is still safe after someone that took it just up and died for obvious reasons. Helps me to make a common sense decision, lets call it a spidey sense! That's when i have to lookout!
1	I look at it as yes, there is some risk to the vaccine, since it's only been studied 3 months or so, but there is definite risk to Covid. I am high-risk so I'll chance it with the vaccine.
0	I lost a million dollars job because of vaccine mandate. My employer said take it or give up my badge. I gave them my badge without any regrets.
0	I lost my Mom and Dad both, within 8 months after they both took the shots. Both were pretty healthy before and my Dads heart stopped, and my poor Mother, suddenly got Cancer, everywhere! The lady blames it on our "emotions ".. Its just like you said, we KNOW what happened.. Were not stupid. I miss my Mom so much, and i wish i could have been there to stop them from taking those shots!
1	I lost my dad to Covid and I’m just 18. I told him many times to get the vaccine, but he was skewed by political views. It hurts a lot to see him gone. Im sorry if you rely on your news station to tell you what’s best for you. It is your decision. Don’t come to a decision and never look back. Stay open minded. Think about those around you. Life is precious
0	I love how people use “anti vaxers” as a way to belittle or dismiss them when quite frankly many of them have extremely valid intelligent arguments as to their stance.
0	I mean if the vaccines were worth a shit they would sell themselves - no need for all the forced vaccination initiatives.
1	I mean people should know that vaccines doesn’t prevent you from getting COVID. It only lower the risks of you dying having it.
1	I mean with scientists from every corner of the globe working together and sharing data to accomplish this singular task it would be kind of depressing if it had taken the same amount of time as usual
0	I nearly lost my job from vaccine mandates but I stuck to my guns & didn't take it. Thank you Dr Campbell for all your work in seeking the truth.
1	I need covid shot, where I live I can't get one, I'm old and at high risk. that's why I can't get one
0	I never got the vaccine despite the pressure. I know I'm lucky to have been able to avoid it but others were forced to take it to avoid losing their jobs or getting essential services. Around the time people were getting vaccinated, 2 of my mom's colleagues died of stroke and heart failure. I always wonder if it had something to do with the vaccine. I would hate to die from taking something I never needed in the first place.
0	I never got the vaccine. Far as I know I have never had Covid. I have tested several time because people I was in contact with had it. I tested negitive every time. My friends and family who have had the vaccine keep getting covid.
0	I never got vaccinated, neither did my brother. We both only Caught covid once . It was like a prolonged cold. That was it. My friends had the full vaccine box set, and has caught covid three times and has been out for the count every time.
0	I never have taken one and I never will. I'm healthy and I'll take my chances without an unsecessary jab thanks!!
0	I never wanted the vax, fought it for so long. Didn't work for over 6 months due to mandates in Australia, but I ran out of money and had to get it or lose my job that they were holding for me. Wish I held off a bit longer, as I constantly get sick now. Never used to. My immune system seems broken now.
0	I not taking the chance.I just staying home.These vaccine wasn't tested properly
1	I once had a nightmare where Antivaxxers took over the UN and banned vaccines and Autism. Then there was a knock at the door. I woke up before I could open the door.
1	I overheard a women at my local grocery story telling the, very uninterested, butcher about how the vaccine changes your DNA. Couldn’t help but chuckle to myself.
0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections
0	I personally know 2 people who have died within 48 hours of taking the second injection. One 68, the other 85. I'm never putting this into my system as I am elderly too
0	I read some people have died from taking a shot.That is more scary than a cold/virus.
1	I really appreciate this information. My entire family had no hesitation getting doubly vaccinated, except for our 10 year old grandson. There’s nothing available for him yet. We will also be getting a booster shot next year. I wish people would wake up.
1	I received the vaccine yesterday! i am in healthcare. i have only had a sore arm and a slight feeling of hotness. other than that i feel great!
0	I refuse up get any vaccine that's this new
0	I regret it massively, I didnt have chest pains until I got the fuckin thing. Went to a bunch of doctors and they always came back with no results and its like "nope, you're healthy no idea why you have chest pains" never went for a booster. Now 3 years later it hurts maybe once or twice a month.
0	I regret taking this poison.
0	I reject your 666 inject!
1	I respect your freedom of choice. My family member was infected and spent 65 days in intensive care, in a coma a good part of that time. He racked up a $3 million dollar hospital bill, so make sure your insurance will cover at least that much. Even if you die, your spouse will still be liable for the bill.
1	I scheduled to get mine as soon as I could and I’m getting Dose 1 today.
0	I should never have taken it 😔 I hope my body will recover soon
1	I sometimes feel like antivaxers try there best to purposely get someone sick so they don't vaccinated how much sense does that make that will just make someone want to get vaccinated more.
1	I still believe that vaccines work.
0	I still regret ever taking it though because i work from home so i should've never been vaccinated in the first place but don't know why i let peer pressure get the best of me. Even my family now are regretting it lol because they were pro vaccine for quite a while and they finally woken upmy dad even now calls the vaccine "poison" and he also said that he will not be getting any of those "new boosters" good for him for not getting it
1	I still see so many people say "I feel sorry for all of these unvaccinated people. It's really tragic how they've been misled!" At first I agreed, but at this point, they are adults who have made their decisions, and their decisions are ruining millions of people's lives. They need to be held responsible, rather than felt sorry for at this point.
1	I still think the odds are better than good and would take it. Send it to Ontario.
1	I stopped watching as soon as the lady started crying and said “none of us knows why”. I can only speak for myself, but as a member of the healthcare community, I have dedicated tens of thousands of hours into my education, research, clinical trials, etc. As a medical professional it kills me to hear people with zero education, experience or understanding preach to others about the “dangers” of vaccines! If you don’t have knowledge or experience changing a transmission, are you going to change it yourself or possibly take your vehicle to a professional to ensure the job is done properly? The same principle applies to medical advice!!! Would you rather Betty who has all of 100 hours of basic classroom education or a doctor who earned their degree, finished their clinicals, completed their residency and has 20+ years actual medical experience?
1	I strongly believe that vaccination is a highly effective way to reduce the risk of hospitalization, severe illness, and death associated with the virus.
0	I suffered severe prolonged side effects from 2 x pfizer shots in 2021. No way am I having another.
0	I swear bro don't take it unless you really have to. Otherwise it's not worth it.
1	I tested positive last Thursday. I felt tired for three days and played a lot of video games. Isolating from the rest of my family was a bigger chore than the disease. Vaccinations work.
0	I think I'll trust in my own immune system thank you. If I die from covid then it wasn't meant to be
0	I think I'll trust in my own immune system thank you. If I die from covid then it wasn't meant to be 🤷♀️
1	I think god just made covid 19 for eliminate all anti-vaxxers
0	I think the main reason is people are starting to realize these vaccines don’t work and all they are doing is making a bunch of criminals richer. These vaccines have been killing people, and this isn’t conspiracy theorists talking, the data is all there for anyone to see. The CDC has seen the data and they don’t care. They are more interested in keeping this money making machine going.
1	I think the vaccine is ok.
1	I think they will probably make limitations for your daily life if you don’t take the vaccine so you will be kind of forced to take it :/
1	I think this is very helpful information. Unfortunately, in Japan, there are a few people who are skeptical about vaccines. I hope that the correct knowledge will spread.
1	I think we should just appreciate how incredibly hardworking these vaccine researchers have worked. Under a Year to develop a vaccine like this is only possible because of the dedication and commitment of researchers. I'm sure these vaccines will save thousands of lives
1	I thinks its beneficial. It helps your immune system resist the virus so that even if you do catch it, the symptoms will probably be not as severe.
0	I thought they were going to show how it creates a blood clot and makes you start shaking and seizing up and then dying from your injuries.
1	I took both vaccines from pfizer and feel perfectly well, its my 10th day following the second shot. just a one day arm pain. Now its up to you, either get rid of the virus or let it mutate into something stronger so that all this is useless and we'd need to go back to basics.
1	I took my first dose of Pfizer's vaccine on Friday. I am happy.
1	I took the first Moderna vaccine 27 days ago. 14 days ago, my husband test positive for C-19 after he became symptomatic . My grandson and I tested five days later after my husband experienced symptoms. My grandson tested positive. I tested negative. I’am taking the second shot tomorrow! I’am a firm believer that the vaccine works!
0	I took vaccine from FLU when I was 10 with my brother it was so bad were seriously sick for 2 weeks very badly so since then don';t want to take any vaccines.
0	I truly believe it's the vaccinated making the non-jabbed sick, I never used to get sick at all and now that my wife took the clot shot for work (I pleaded with her not to) I'm always sick, the kids too.
0	I truly feel sorry for the people who got the jab. That thing is a ticking time bomb.
0	I trust my mask more than any of the Covid-19 Vaccines.
0	I trust that vaccine about as much as I trust the 2020 presidential election…
1	I try to explain it to anti vaxxers and they just say “I don’t believe that” it’s like playing chess with pigeons.
0	I understand that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is the same as hesitancy for other vaccines in general
1	I used to be a Covid denier back in March of 2020, and thought it was some lame new strain of flu. It wasn't until one of my idols (Rick May) and relatives died of it that I started to realize this is serious. I'm so ashamed that it took people I looked up to dying to take this seriously. It's my biggest regret in life, I wish people would just listen instead of trying to be so self-righteous. Please everyone, stay safe, and like a good life. Update: I've now gotten my 3rd shot, and am hoping to be able to get the 4th. Stay safe, friends.
1	I used to cry and hide as a child when I had to get vaccines and thought that I was somehow being punished. Now, I’m very glad that my parents got me vaccinated. After my mom told me about the symptoms of tetanus at around 12 years old and compared what tetanus does to a person versus just getting one jab that’s over quickly, I started to think differently about vaccines. I knew that it wasn’t to hurt me, but to protect me and others who can’t get vaccinated. (Newborns, people with certain autoimmune disorders, etc.) My parents went through chickenpox and other things as children that I never even had to think about as a kid. As somebody who’s turning 26 next month, I’m no longer scared of vaccines and even used to get B-12 injections weekly at one point because although I eat red meat, my body doesn’t break down the B-12 vitamin very well for some reason.
1	I want the vaccine SO MUCH. This past year has been hell on my mental health, and the moment I get the message that I'm eligible, I'm booking the earliest appointment available, but here in Denmark, that won't be until summer.
1	I want to be vaccinated
0	I want to share my personal experience regarding vaccines. Despite what experts say, I rely on what I see. I have observed that vaccinated individuals are getting sick multiple times and missing work, while unvaccinated individuals remain healthy and productive.
1	I wanted to get the vaccine ASAP but I wasn't keeping up to date on when I could or how I could. Now I'm signed up to get it.
0	I was FORCED to get a shot or I was thrown out at 17, displayed my concerns heavily but completely dismissed by a ignorant parent. Now I gotta hope I don’t fall over and croak in the next decade even though I live a healthy lifestyle
0	I was a healthy 56 yr old woman and suffered pretty serious vaccine injury....weird inflammatory condition..that I'm just now after 2 yrs getting over. Please look into it carefully before going ahead with more boosters. Also, my friend lost hearing in one year after the Moderna booster and the hearing has not returned after a year. I would NEVERv get another covid vaccine
1	I was afraid to get vaccines because of my RA and allergies. But last week I had my 1st pfizer vaccines. On October 2nd will be the schedule for 2nd dose. At this point I can only say, " Que sera sera, whatevah will be... will be..."
1	I was also one who worried about how quickly this vaccine was developed. In reality the scientists have used years...make that decades of research to develop it. When it comes right down to it, If we can’t trust science who can we trust? I’ll be ready to take the vaccine when my turn comes.
0	I was anti-mandate, not anti-vax, until the govt and media destroyed any trust I’ve had this past year.
1	I was born in 1951. The measles vaccine wasn’t developed until 1963. I got measles as did many of my friends. One friend ended up with heart damage and another went deaf. So you bet my kids were vaccinated on schedule. For everything.
1	I was diagnosed with epilepsy at 20 and my neurologist sat down with me and spent the time coming up with a list of medications that would work best for me and he went down each one and explained the pros and cons. I have a lot of respect for him and trust him. And as a scientist, I trust that vaccines do more good than harm.
1	I was fine with both AZ but sick for a few days with each booster - one Moderna and one Pfizer. I wouldn’t hesitate to do it again.
1	I was fully vaccinated. When I caught Covid, I barely knew I had it. Everyone at the party had it, all vaccinated, and all had extremely mild symptoms. Can’t speak for everyone, but vaccines at least worked for the 50 people at one party.
0	I was gonna get it until a close friend of mine got the first dose & almost died so I’m good thank you
1	I was initially vaccinated in March 2021, and I got covid in August 2021, I only had some cough and a headache for the first few days. But I did very well and was so grateful I was vaccinated. Now I'm boosted 3 times.
1	I was just able to get my elderly parents, both 70+ the first round of the Moderna vaccine yesterday here in PA. Feel very relieved
1	I was on the fence also until I got COVID-19. I didn't get it has bad as him but it was the worst experience I got . Heading to seven months in the AC19 . I am still having a cough, my taste buds changed and yes I took the booster. Never me again with that virus
0	I was one of those people who did not trust or plan to get the shot , but after about a year and a half , i decided to get the shot because my job put me at great risk of catching Covid , but I wish i stood my ground, and never taken it; won't be taking anymore ! My blood pressure went up after the shot , and I've been on a blood pressure so called medication that also has terrible side effects.
0	I was pro Covid vaccine for the first couple shots, but as more and more info came out it was revealed that it didn’t really help that much against Covid and natural immunity was actually better. Plus the vaccine companies lied about their effectiveness just so they could make billions in taxpayer dollars. The inventor of the vaccine has admitted this. So that’s why I am anti Covid vax.
0	I was pro vaccine back when this whole pandemic felt brand new because at the time i thought that a vaccine would "save us" but i would say that I'm more enlightened now than ever before. I got vaccinated and regretted it as soon as i took it because i wasn't the same ever since.
1	I was scared at first but it wasnt that bad after all
1	I was terrified to get the vaccine because I don’t like doctors in general and have major anxiety about pretty much everything. However, John’s video really convinced me that I had to get the vaccine because it was necessary to help myself and those people around me to my care about and would hate to cause to be sick. The whole day, I was so worried that I couldn’t focus on anything else. I went to my appointment a week early by accident and forced myself to stand in line to see if they could get me in. I ended up getting it that day. I’m glad I just did it because now I don’t have to think about it. It was way less hassle than I thought it would be and didn’t hurt pretty much at all.
1	I was the only person in my family of 5 who did not have covid last week. I was the only one who got the booster.
0	I was thinking about not getting it. But now that it’s being forced. I’m definitely NOT getting it 😂.
0	I was vaccine neutral until this mRNA injection came along... RED FLAGS everywhere.
0	I will NEVER TRUST our GOVERNMENT EVER AGAIN.
0	I will NEVER vaccinate my child. I love him!
1	I will certainly take a new Covid vaccine/booster!! The better I’m covered the better I feel.
1	I will definitely get it but I don't mind waiting a bit for the people who really need it to have it first.
1	I will definitely take whatever vaccines and boosters come my way, be it for COVID or anything else! Why? I was always the sickly child, and even as an adult, if there is something to be caught, I catch it (I’ve had COVID twice so far). However, since I always avail myself of any protective measures there are, I’m still alive and kicking at almost 76. Getting the COVID vaccines and boosters doesn’t mean you can’t get the virus; it means your body is in a better position to fight it off if and when you do get it. Get it?
0	I will die before I get this vaccine I don't trust it
0	I will die form a Covid-19 pneumonia rather than a blood clot from the vaccine.
0	I will fight to death and protect what Jesus gave me.. suffer first and have Eternal life in heaven
1	I will get it as soon as I'm able.
1	I will get whatever vaccine I can. I am not picky. I want this virus dead before it turns into something bigger, deadlier, or worst of all, something that our vaccines don’t work on.
0	I will never get Vax or tested I'm fine from day 1
0	I will never let them jab me even if i have to quit my job... NEVER IM TALKING FIGHT
0	I will never take a coronavirus vaccine, there’s a reason why their blowing this all out of proportion
0	I will never take a vaccine that hasn't been through phase 3 testing. No one knows the long term effects of this.
0	I will never take dat poison!! You can have all my family’s doses!! Thank me later!!
0	I will never take it. And I had corona in Christmass week, very mild thank god! Natural immumity feels so good.
0	I will not take it
0	I will not. I do not find enough info in the studies to trust
0	I will rather take care of my COVID and treat it I don’t have COVID but it’s really stupid cause it’s like they put crack in the vaccine I’m glad I don’t take it
0	I will stick to my natural immunity instead of your killing drug.
0	I will take my chances on a virus that has a 99.6% survival rate
0	I will trust my immune system. no jab for me.
0	I wish I agreed but losing my sister after getting vaccinated leaves me suspicious and wary.
1	I wish this kind of videos is what the media told in the news. I've never felt so hopeful about COVID until this video. Well done!
1	I wish we could send people back in time to see what it was like when huge percentages of children died from diseases before they reached age 5. It would offer some much-needed perspective.
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me I was sick for 6 months
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me. I was sick for 6 months.
0	I won't take it no matter what.
1	I wonder how many people in the comment section are claiming this doctor’s lying. It’s like people would rather feed into fear than protecting themselves or others. Let alone getting things back to normal.
0	I wonder if the incompetent doctor and interviewer know that in some nations, the pandemic is over? And if they know the reason why? (hint: they have under 10% jab rate)
0	I wont take any meds from someone who talked about depopulation a few years ago..hell no
0	I won’t take this ever. I’ll rely on my immune system thanks
1	I work at a nursing home and I can’t wait for this to come out to us
1	I work with a woman who got polio. She isn’t old and the vaccine was available to her but her mother made a choice and it costs this wonderful woman her health. After she got polio and ended up with a dreadful limp and would end up in a wheelchair for the majority of her life. Her life has been spent in so much pain and she was so limited in what she could do. She was an amazing actor and only got to do a little bit child. So I can’t image how the side effects could be worse.
0	I would NEVER consider myself an anti-vaxer but you gotta be out your damn mind to immediately take a vaccine that was characterized for being one of the fastest to make it through trials...
1	I would feel a lot better if a booster was mandated for everyone once a quarter. I bet the cases and deaths would disappear very quickly.
1	I would get it after people with my medical condition can get it successfully. But once that happens I definitely will!
1	I would make antivaxxers here in Canada sign a waver that they must pay their covid medical expenses out of pocket
0	I would never even experience those side effects you call "NORMAL"
1	I would rather deal with the issues of the vaccines than have my child die from those diseases that the vaccines have proven to prevent.
0	I would rather go to prison than take that poison!
0	I would wait 6 months to see how it affects people.
1	I'd get one monthly if they made it work that way. Came close to not surviving the virus, don't want it again.
1	I'd love to see a vaccine that is strongly effective against you getting COVID and really stops the spread. Don't get me wrong. I'm thrilled for the vaccines we have. I'll continue to get whatever boosters are available and recommended. I don't doubt they've saved millions of lives. I went from seeing 40 year olds die of covid to seeing 95 year olds with few symptoms thanks to vaccines. I just miss that hope we had at the beginning of vaccines when we thought they were 98% effective.
0	I'd rather eat glass.
0	I'd rather take my supplements...... you can have my share of the vaccine
1	I'll happily take both vaccines if there are so many idiots who will forfeit theirs.
0	I'll never listen to anything another "doctor" has to say for the rest of my life.
0	I'll say no to a vaccine but I'll take a double triple bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four animal style, with a shimmy and a squeeze, burn it and let it swim
0	I'll take my chances with a 3 day cough instead of this vaccine.
0	I'll take my chances without the vaccine thank you.
0	I'll take the first shot because I needed the money. They paid me to take the first shot and i'm still having chest pains
1	I'm 16 and I got my vaccine 2 days after my 16th birthday, this is so important guys, you can do this!!!
1	I'm 24 and I got my first dose a little under a week ago! Even just having the first dose lowered my anxiety about being outside and around other people so much. I can't wait to be fully vaccinated and for my family and friends to be fully vaccinated so that I can see them again!
1	I'm 25 and vaccinated and I couldn't wait to get it. I got it as soon as it was available for everyone. Amazing feeling to finally be part of ending this pandemic.
0	I'm 5-times unvaccinated. From what I'm reading, I'll be refusing my 6th dose very soon
0	I'm a doctor myself and my issue is the mandating of the vaccine for NHS workers or anyone else for that matter. Compelling people to put something into their bodies that they don't want is a dangerous road to go down
1	I'm a habitually cynical individual. I had my first dose of your vaccine yesterday though. Suddenly there's light at the end of a long dark tunnel.
1	I'm a habitually cynical individual. I had my first dose of your vaccine yesterday though. Suddenly there's light at the end of a long dark tunnel. Thank you Pfizer.
1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow
1	I'm a nurse and the idea of a vaccine being available soon is so exciting, I don't work on a covid floor but it still is having a huge impact on my patients and my work day.
1	I'm a pretty young person myself and I've been waiting a couple weeks for vaccines to even open up for appointments in my county. Although I'm still waiting, many others don't have to right now. If you're one of those young people who aren't getting the vaccine, please acknowledge how privileged you are and important it is to get one.
1	I'm a republican but I believe in the science of modern medicine and I have faith in the science behind the physiology of the human body as well as the science behind the vaccine anti vaxers are just plain stupid
0	I'm a simple man. When the Dr. who created the MRNA technology said it wasnt safe, that is all i needed to hear.
1	I'm allergic to eggs so had a reaction to a flu vaccine before I realized I had an egg allergy. It's really hard to get a non-egg based flu vaccine so I just have to go without. It shouldn't be an issue with the COVID vaccines and given the impact COVID can have on people I don't want to have to worry about inadvertently giving anyone the disease. I'm with Hank I'll be looking forward to getting the vaccine.
1	I'm an Aussie working as a Firefighter in the US. Got my second shot of the Moderna coved vaccine yesterday I have a bit of a headache and feel a bit tired but I also work 48 hours shifts so tired in nothing new. Get the shot Australia.
1	I'm an immunocompromised essential front line worker (social worker with ulcerative colitis who frequently meets with people in their homes) bring on the vaccine!!!
1	I'm beginning to think that anyone who still distrusts boosters should maybe go to China and see how that is working out for them. The shortage of hospital beds for Covid sufferers is truly horrifying.
1	I'm bombarded with people telling me why they wouldn't get the vaccine. It's nice to hear a voice of reason.
0	I'm donating mine to gov officials
1	I'm excited about COVID vaccines.
1	I'm fully vaxxed and boosted! And damned proud of it! I'm not risking a child's health due my own selfish needs. Period.
1	I'm getting a booster shot on Thursday while it's still free. Glad we finally have Covid under control. It was a long 3 years.
1	I'm getting my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today and this comes up. thank you for such an informative video
1	I'm getting my first dose tomorrow and I feels so nice to have the end in sight I could almost cry
0	I'm glad I didn't take any covid shots since my ticker is a little on the weak side. Getting the flu shot this year was bad enough, I got sick a fever and dental neuralgia, etc about a week after the shot.
1	I'm glad I got it and the boosters. I only got Covid-19 once (so far) and it was pretty mild.
0	I'm glad I'm not dead from the shot. I did get eczema!!!!!
0	I'm glad I'm not vaccinated with that Covid-19 vaccine.
1	I'm going now to get vaccinated
0	I'm happy that I never got the clot shot.
1	I'm hyped for this vaccine, even if I grow a third limb
1	I'm in Portugal and I'll take the first vaccine made available as soon as I can get one, that's the least I can do in the name of those who lost their lives and didn't get a fight chance.
1	I'm in for vaccination and booster shot and also wearing a mask at all times.
0	I'm kinda hoping that my job would make it mandatory to take the vaccine, so I would have a solid reason to quit.
1	I'm looking forward to the day(s) I get mine. Living in Europe however, it is unclear when this will be. Until that day follow advice and stay safe.
1	I'm needlephobic and I got my first vaccination. Scheduled for my second too.
0	I'm not an anti vax but I would seriously want to stay away from this vaccine for a few years because this technology of developing vaccine is never been used before.
0	I'm not anti vaccine but I have my concerns due to how fast they are being rushed out. I may wait a few months first
0	I'm not getting it... I dont trust you guys...✝️❤ nwo coming soon👍
1	I'm not sure of how good of a nurse she will be if she doesn't believe in medicine.
0	I'm not taking it because the former Presidents will take it for me. It's funny how the mainstream media forcing and labeling people anti vaxx.
1	I'm not worried about taking it, but I already had covid, so it would be in better use for someone who needs it.
1	I'm one. Delta almost killed me. If I hadn't been vaccinated I know I wouldn't be here.
1	I'm really glad to say that my entire friend group and family has been quick to get the vaccine as soon as it was available to them. I sleep so much better at night knowing my favorite people are almost definitely not going to die from this disease
1	I'm so excited about the vaccine! I wish we could get it right now. This is fantastic news! Merry Christmas everyone! 🎆💖🎄☃️☮️😊
0	I'm so glad I never got that poison
0	I'm so glad that my family and I didn't participate in their experiment
1	I'm so glad we finally have a vaccine to protect the people who actually need it out there, let's end the war covid-19 together with our vaccines
0	I'm so not getting it. Lol
0	I'm someone who NEVER gets allergies now after taking both doses I have ALLERGIES!
0	I'm sorry Doctor that you have sold your soul to these elites
0	I'm still 17 and took vaccine at 15 yrs age... After vaccine my health got downhill and developed high Bp and heart issues and I'm still young
0	I'm still amazed how my mum got Covid recently, ended up hospitalized (she's a risk group and had a bacterial lung coinfection), and all people seemed to ask were: But she did get all the vaccine doses? How easy it is to be brainwashed if you're not able to find or interpret "reliable" sources (this channel is gold for me). Glad I was considered an antivxx (which I'm certainly not, exceptions include vxs in trial phase with unknown and possibly severe common side effects), and glad my sense making skills seem to have helped me once again. People, PLEASE don't inject your healthy little child with this, and trust in their amazing immune system, since it will do more harm than good.
0	I'm still not taking that evil vaccine
0	I'm still not taking this vaccine. More people survive this plandemic then deaths. They push this harder than anything else.
0	I'm still on shot 0, quite effective.
0	I'm still waiting for you to report on all the vaccine accidents!
1	I'm vaccinated, everyone I know is vaccinated. 95% of my country is vaccinated. I don't see any negative effects of this.
1	I'm very glad I got it and I will happily get any boosters that come my way. I'm high risk, so being vaccinated means I can feel confident about getting back to the things I liked to do before the pandemic, like going to shows.
0	I've always been incredibly healthy and have rarely ever been sick which means that my immune system is rather alive and well. I have little concerns about catching the virus, and since I've grown aware of the possible dangers of obtaining the "vaccine", I know that I don't want, nor do I need the "vaccine".
0	I've always been proud to be called an anti-vaxer, wore it like a badge and was never ashamed of it in any way shape or form. I am what I am and that's what I am.
0	I've been flush since I got it. I don't feel well and am always very tired. I would have not gotten if I knew this....
1	I've been fully vaccinated and so has my husband. I must know at least 100 other people who have been vaccinated and everyone is doing just fine. You paranoid maniac. Don't believe us. We're just evidence.
0	I've been saying these vaccines aren't good.
0	I've been skeptical on the vaccine from day one. I don't like that it was rushed although I understand why it was. First we were told that once we got it we wouldn't have to worry now pfizer is coming out and saying we will need a booster every year like a flu shot.
1	I've been vaccinated against polio, measles, typhoid, smallpox, tetanus, hepatitus c and a few others that I can't remember. I'll be having this one too. ISN'T SCIENCE WONDERFUL?
1	I've been waiting for Novavax! Thank God they are finally giving us an option other than mRNA.
1	I've been waiting for the full approval, got my first shot scheduled for about an hour from now.
1	I've gotten 5 Pfizer shots and i've been fine , no side effects at all. This message goes out to the ones that have not gotten a covid shot. I protect me and others.
1	I've had all of mine. The last one didn't even give me a sore arm as the others had. I am glad to have been fully vaccinated but I still take precautions.
0	I've had months of chest pain after the moderna injection. Thanks, world!
0	I've had more patients lose their job from vaccine mandates than covid positive patients in 1 year.
0	I've had two doses but I won't be having another next year because I'm getting breathing' problems since the 2nd jab. I had the virus last year and recovered. I'll take the risk of getting it again in future. My personal choice.
1	I've just got my first dose. I am proud of such used technology. Hope to see its effect in other ways.
0	I've known so many who have had terrible reactions and heart problem. Even several deaths 😭 I'm so glad me and mine didn't get it!!!
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice...
0	I've never regretted not getting any synthetic mRNA injections, and every day I'm more relieved that I didn't.
0	I've not had the vaccine and I feel great!
0	I've tried to catch covid. The only corona I can find comes in a 6 and 12 pack.
0	I, my family, THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA are against THE OFFER with WHO, we are for leaving WHO, DOWN WITH FASCISM IN THE WORLD
0	IF SOMETHING IS FREE, THEN YOU ARE THE PRODUCT
1	IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN YOUR THIRD SHOT (or the vaccin at all) GET IT!!! Covid 19 is still a thing!
0	IM TERRIFIED OF GETTING THE VACCINE); I don’t trust the gov- it came out too fast. Iv been having panic attacks everyday if my job forces me to get one
1	IT HAPPENED!!!!!!!! I got my first dose of the #PfizerBioNTech vaccine today - THE BEST HOLIDAY PRESENT EVER!!!
0	IT IS AN EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE (the consent form tells us) YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THEIR EVIL EXPERIMENT! It's as simple as that. STAND FIRM AND FIGHT! God said don't ever get the shot ....pray and confirm in JESUS name!
1	Iam am pro-vax and don't want a rushed vaccine.
0	If I can’t sue them, I’m not getting the vaccine. Actually I won’t get the vaccine period.
0	If I was to get vaccinated it’s going to be in five years. Many things could go wrong such as late side effects. When people get a high dose of radiation, they don’t get cancer straight away it takes time.
0	If a 4th shot can't stop it, why would the previous 3?
1	If for no other reason, think about this: imagine never being able to taste your favorite foods or drinks again or not being able to smell the pages of a book. That's my reality as a healthcare worker who got covid before the vaccine was available.
0	If it doesn't affect the body, why did I have chills and fever for two days each time? It's all a big lie. By the time it's figured out, we'll all be able to be remote controlled.
0	If it is so safe, why do they tell us they will not be held responsible for any adverse affects.
0	If it was safe then why did my mom an fnp tell me 3 out of the four people who came in yesterday at her place of work who were diagnosed with covid yesterday were already vaccinated?
0	If it worked you wouldnt need to convince any one lol
0	If it's so great let's all vaccine companies get sued if things go wrong. Then people might take it.
0	If it’s 95% effective, what are the consequences to the remaining 5%? Is it side effects or death? Honestly, it has to be 100%. 95% is not yet perfect because in 100 people 5 will still be get (the infection)..?
1	If no one decided to take the vaccine, we wouldn't make any progress!
1	If only all these people had the same concerns about food,illegal drugs and alcohol as they so about a vaccine that is 99.99% safe we would be a hell of a lot healthier.
0	If so impressed with the vaccine why hasn't the creator taken it and how impressive is it covid still infecting vaccinated people
0	If the company is immune to being sued. Thats a super big RED FLAG
0	If the flu and COVID have similar mortality rates then why worry about it? Everyone doesn’t take a flu shot.....so why should anyone take a COVID shot?
0	If the government is pushing you to take something into your body be aware
0	If they are so confident about the Vax why is there no legal indemnity???? The risk is entirely yours no redress if you are damaged/ killed.
1	If they got covid because the refused to get a vaccine, I agree not to treat them
0	If they lockdown again, I won’t trust the vaccine to keep me safe. No matter what the “experts” say.
0	If they try to inject me with this vaccine I'm gonna inject them with lead
0	If this vaccine was truly studied and well researched we shouldn't have to even be asking this question. The fact that we are says a lot.
1	If we get enough people vaccinated in the entire population, there won't be as many people to care for infected with SARS-COV-2. Here's hoping we can get to that point sooner rather than later.
1	If you don’t trust those in the medical profession then why go to the hospital to the same people you distrust?
1	If you don’t want to get vaccinated, that’s your choice - but don’t think you are going to get on a plane or a train and put vaccinated people at risk
0	If you get vaccinated or allow any family to get vaccinated under your care, you are voluntarily killing your loved ones. The vaccine is not good for you. Period.
0	If you want the vaccine, go take it. Me? No thanks.
1	If you're still not vaccinated then I dgaf if you get covid.
1	If you’re more afraid of getting vaccinated than you are of getting Covid and Covid complications, then you need to brush up on your high school math skills. The statistics are brutally obvious as to which is the safer option.
1	If you’re unvaccinated, you’re about 8 times more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19 than if you’ve had both doses of the vaccine and the booster.
0	If you’ve done your research from the real scientists you would know never to take this experimental gene therapy! 1,000’s have been injured or have died! This so called ‘vaccination’ isn’t even approved by the FDA! If you’re listening to Fauci you’re forked!!
0	If “vaccines” are so safe and effective, then why aren’t they safe and effective?
1	Ignorance is a gateway drug to conspiracy theorist. Unfortunately there is no vaccine for that.
0	Ill just quit my job and stay home to teach my kids and continue to grow my own food like we should be living while everyone else become part of the genetic dna altering experiment
0	Ill take my chances with covid, its working so far. I wont let my kids take it.
0	Im a hospital worker and I officially got fired for not getting the shot. I took a stand so hopefully the mandate will stop with us. Good luck everyone. Dont cave
0	Im convinced the covid vaccine has messed up my immune system . Never had flu in my life before but now ive been ill for 5 weeks
1	Im from singapore . Already vaccinated and i feel strong
1	Im getting my covid vaccine
0	Im going to wait for ten or more years and if people still around i will take vaccine then NOT!
0	Im happy to not get that blood cloth spike crap in my body
0	Im not having it, no way
1	Im pretty sure plenty rather have vaccine then catch covid
0	Im regret to get injection
0	Im so disgusted with all the LIES. thousands are dying and mamed. STOP THE SHOTS NOW HOW MANY MUST DIE?
1	Im vaxed and feel AMAZING!!!!
0	Imagine a virus so deadly you need to be manipulated into taking the vaccine.
1	Imagine being so upset over a vaccine you don’t want that you stop others from getting it.
0	Imagine believing a Pharma company about a new drug. Pfizer has a long history of peddling drugs with secret severe side effects. Just look up the lawsuits, drug recalls, secret unapproved clinical trials... I don't mind vaccines that have been proven and used for decades, but unless you're about to die it seems crazy to agree to taking new drugs.
0	Imagine getting 4 vaccines in one year, still getting sick, and calling the unvaccinated people crazy.
0	Imagine getting 5 vaccines in a year, catching COVID, then bragging about how great the vaccine is.
1	Immunization can be achieved as soon as possible after vaccination
1	Important point! The vaccine is working. It’s not because Omicron is all that mild
0	In Africa we don't want poison
1	In October of 2021 I was next in line for the vaccine treatment, I got my first booster in April of 2022 and then again in late September 2022. On January tenth of 2023, I requested and received the current vaccination for the newest strain of the virus. I feel great. Oh by the way, I am nearly seventy !!
1	In here so I can answer my relatives when they try to cast doubt on vaccine on me.
0	In my circle of family and friends EVERY single one of them have had negative adverse side effects, heart attacks and heart conditions strokes and cancer.
0	In other words, WHO is saying all those who were vaccinated you are the guinea pigs for their experiment
0	In the USA, you try to force this poison on us you better be prepared to eat lead.
1	Incredibly blessed to have gotten my second dose today. Feel lousy side effects but it’s worth it.
0	Individual responsibility to maintain your immune systems. It’s as simple as Vitamins C & D3, Zinc, Quercetin and I added Turmeric, NAC and vitamin K2. Haven’t been sick in 3 years and I noticed my spring time allergies have gone away. Not bad for someone in their 70’s And NOT vaxxed.
0	Individuals who had adverse reactions were IGNORED! How many lost their lives because the jab was NOT tested properly?
0	Infections in the United States are down by 44%. I believe that this is because everybody is already infected. The covid19 hibernates and the only way to detect hibernating covid19 is in the stool. So why do we need vaccines? Especially since masks and social distancing is still going to be required.
1	Injections beat infections!
0	Instead of the population, why the same scientists who designed it, don't receive the first shots if they are so sure it won't risk their health?
1	Internet moms: vaccines are safe-ish Well it's better than having your child dead-ish
0	Ironically I used to watch these videos until he started defending the vax. It’s so great to see he sees the TRUTH now
0	Is this fake vaccine the solution of this fake Corona?
1	It amazes me how many people would rather believe nonsense than the truth. People fear what they don’t understand.
1	It amazes me how people are still in denial simply because their egos can't tolerate how wrong they have been this whole time. And on top of that they feel like they're the intelligent ones.
0	It didn't save anything. And it's actually injured way more people than they want to admit.
1	It didn’t hurt me in any way
1	It helps to prevent serious illness and death due to COVID-19 for both children and adults.
0	It is a “Human Right Violation” to force someone to take chemical in their body by restricting freedom!!!
1	It is considered as a safer way to protect yourself compared to getting sick with the virus that causes COVID-19.
1	It is crucial to prioritize vaccination and not delay in getting vaccinated. Vaccines are proven to work and have saved countless lives. So, let's take action and protect ourselves and our communities by getting vaccinated.
0	It is not that people are against vaccination but most people just feel that the vaccine will be rushed and without any knowledge of the long term consequences.
1	It is really hard to have any sympathy for the unvaccinated just now.
1	It is safe
0	It looks sceptical about government givig COVID vaccine free of cost
0	It means the shot is poison, and the immune system is suffering.
0	It never was a public health emergency. I lived my life without ever participating. Never wore a mask, never got a phony test, never got a clot shot. I will live as always.
1	It prevents us from needing to go to the hospital due to COVID-19.
1	It seems to me that there’s nothing about these vaccines that should cause problems. They’re mRNA delivery services. After that, it’s just the body/cells processing mRNA, as it always does.
0	It takes YEARS to find out if a new drug is safe.
0	It usually takes 10 - 15 years for vaccine development and approval. All this is going way too fast at the cost of lives. We're basically in the clinical trial phase now.
0	It was safe and effective, not? It was tested and the short term side effects were known, not? It was not a medical test run in the population, not? And probably it all has nothing to do with the gene therapy, not?
0	It wasn’t safe for Lisa Shaw and many more like her. It’s either safe for everyone or it’s not. Conclusion: not safe. You can’t say every death matters when it comes to covid and then put vaccine deaths down as collateral damage.
0	It will mess up your DNA
0	It works perfectly, they dropping like flies
1	It would be great to have a vaccine before contracting the virus. More conventional and similar to the flu shot.
1	It's a great blessing because vaccination is a key factor in returning to a sense of normalcy by enabling the reopening of schools, workplaces, and public spaces. It facilitates a more unrestricted and safer way of life!!
0	It's a no for me dog! Hard Pass!
0	It's an experimental gene therapy. Thousands of healthcare workers have refused to get jabbed because there's not enough data. We're the guinea pigs and there's no guarantee we'll be protected from Covid.
0	It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled' -Mark Twain. You, guys, have been fooled.
1	It's encouraging to hear that the covid 19 vaccine has minimal side effects, and is helping to reduce hospitalization rates.
0	It's funny how we were all raised not to be peer-pressured into taking experimental drugs, and now we're all being peer-pressured into taking experimental drugs.
1	It's gonna be like a fucking freight train. Once we pick up speed we're golden. Especially once Biden invokes DPA and it's all hands on deck.
1	It's gratifying to hear her call anti-vaxxers a cult. And it's scary to see how easily people became anti-vax.
0	It's highly toxic and poison
1	It's not preventable I had both shots fully vaccinated but I still got covid and spent a few days in the hospital! Doesn't mean not to get it cause being someone who has stage 4 heart failure I think the vaccine did save my life!
0	It's not safe they are trying to mess with our DNA
0	It's one year since this virus started spreading so probably by now almost everyone have had it...no need for a vaccine
1	It's really important vaccinate all people in the airports of the United States. All people who travel to the United States. Thank you.
0	It's rediculous to say being hesitant to the vaccine has anything to do with getting poison injected into your body that it's about politics ! It's Poison and there are plenty cases that people get Covid19 after being vaccinated ! It's kept quiet and given different names trying to tell us the vaccine doesn't work in these people. Cases are popping up all over the US !
0	It's scary that we are putting this in so many people when it was developed so recently and we don't know what the long-term implications are.
0	It's simple. If someone is pushing the vaccine, don't trust them.
0	It's still safer to be unvaccinated, despite what the "experts" tell you.
0	Its critical thinking not jabs that needs to be promoted.
0	Its gonna be a NO for me.
0	Its not about what you believe, but about letting others do and think what they believe... My body, my choice...
1	It’s almost like, and stay with me here, but it’s almost like the vaccines work!
0	It’s amazing how some people are still so trusting and naive, even after they’ve been lied to. And after they KNOW they’ve been lied to
0	It’s an experiment on gullible humans.
0	It’s going to change our dna???! Yea no
1	It’s sad that it takes being on death’s door to realize how important that vaccine is but I applaud those who have the courage to admit when they were wrong. -ER Doctor
1	It’s totally safe, they wouldn’t approve it if it wasn’t. Also the vaccine is based off other vaccine technologies that already exist that don’t harm people.
1	Ive been working as a volunteer trying to book people into get their vaccines, this video has some great easy to understand and relay information that I can let people know about so they feel safe and confident so thankyou.
0	I’ll never take this jab!!!
0	I’ll take my chances with getting covid. I don’t trust our government AT ALL
1	I’ll take one. Best minimize my risk.
1	I’ll wait a lil longer...im very excited and hope this works but I’d like a little more testing
0	I’ll wait for the pill version
1	I’m a 23 year old in Australia, and work in a hospital. I thankfully was given the offer to be vaccinated and made sure I took it! So grateful to have the opportunity, since I know so many haven’t yet.
1	I’m a college student so you BET I’m getting that vaccine when it becomes available
0	I’m a healthcare professional. I told my friends and family not to get it. Healthcare professionals learn about how vaccines are made and what is needed before they can be put out. None of that protocol was done. I took a lot of heat for refusing, but I’m glad I held my ground. This is just the beginning. Wait until the whole truth comes out. My condolences to people who lost their lives due to corporate greed!
1	I’m a week out of my pfirst Pfizer vaccine and pso pfar pso good. I haven’t experienced any pside effects, and I’m pfeeling pretty pfenomenal
0	I’m against this vaccine.
0	I’m allergic to dying so I can’t take the vaccine
1	I’m confused because if people don’t want to listen to medical professionals or get vaccinated, why do they come to us at the hospital for help when they get sick ??
1	I’m conservative and I always wear a mask. I got the Pfizer vaccine.
1	I’m consistently shocked at the amount of people I work with who are proud to not be COVID or Flu-vaccinated.
0	I’m definitely not getting it !
0	I’m definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity.
1	I’m done with my 2 shots. Ran 15 km post 1st shot. And ran 10km after 2nd shot. AZ is safe!
1	I’m fine and I don’t know of anybody around here who has had problems with the vaccine.
1	I’m fully dosed!
1	I’m fully vaccinated and pro vaccine. I received moderna and developed disequilibrium a few days after my second dose. It’s been 5 months and it still comes and goes. Have 3 friends with the same issue after moderna. Maybe it’s unrelated. But I really doubt it.
1	I’m getting my second dose today!! It was a pain in the ass convincing my anti-vaxx parents to let me get the vaccine but I am so glad I finally wore them down.
0	I’m glad I’m not alone. I think I’m the only person in my company who has refused the vaccine. I will not take it.
0	I’m going to my friends funeral on Wednesday as a result of the Covid vaccine they are paying his family liabilities
1	I’m grateful that I live in a place and during a time when vaccines are readily available. It’s so easy to get your flu and Covid vaccines every year.
0	I’m happy to know that I won’t be needing post vaccination care because I didn’t injure myself to start with.
1	I’m just glad I’m educated enough to not abuse my children by preventing them from being Vaccinated.
1	I’m loving all the people who know nothing about developing vaccines giving their take in the comments
0	I’m never going to take that vaccine pfffff hell to the no
0	I’m not against vaccines at all. I am against a vaccine for Covid! It has a massive survival rate 99.777%! Eat clean and exercise I’m not taking a vaccine for Covid
0	I’m not an antivax I just don’t trust the covid one
0	I’m not getting this political vaccine
0	I’m not getting vaccine ever
1	I’m not gonna lie, that vaccine recovery was worse then wisdom teeth removal for me...but I’d rather have three days of pain that weeks on a ventilator any day!
1	I’m not sure why anyone would need a Nobel Prize winner to convince them to get vaccinated, but if it helps.
0	I’m not taking an mRNA ever. It’s DNA ALTERING
1	I’m so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
1	I’m sorry America is privileged and DOESNT take advantage of these privileges where as other places are struggling to get this vaccine. I apologize once again.
1	I’m sorry did you see that facebook post my uncle shared about his friend’s friend who randomly died 18 months after getting the vaccine in a car accident at the age of 83? Obviously these vaccines are not safe.
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated
1	I’m the only one in my office who got the latest booster. I’m also the only one in my office who has not had Covid even after being exposed to it. Get your booster, y’all. Unless you enjoy getting sick.
0	I’m trying to get pregnant, has it been tested to ensure that it will not affect my reproductive organs or compromise future pregnancy. The vaccine is just too new. We don’t know the long-term side effects.
0	I’m unvaccinated and I’m perfectly fine…my friends who got vaccinated are always getting sick . Non of this is true….I had the Delta..got sick like having a flue..took my vitamin C and D…HVE NOT BEEN SICK EVER SINCE.
0	I’m unvaccinated and loving it!! My family will NEVER try untested products. Good luck to all that did. We will pray for you and your recovery.
1	I’m up to date ! Received last vaccine in September
1	I’m up to date and glad I am! Will keep following the recommendations.
1	I’m watching this now and I just got my vaccine yesterday. I want to stay safe for my mom which has diabetes.
1	I’ve got every single shot, and I ended up with covid. It was a sore throat and nothing more. It’s amazing how much the vaccines drop the effects.
1	I’ve gotten all the shots and boosters and have not yet gotten Covid.
1	I’ve gotten the vaccine and the boosters, I had Covid once, in January 2022 with no symptoms. I only knew because I tested. I got the flu shot for the first time a couple months ago with the recent Covid booster, and it just maybe anecdotal, but I haven’t gotten flu Covid or any other kind of sickness for a very long time. Knock on wood. maybe it boosted my immune system just in general? I was definitely a little scared to get new vaccines or any vaccines since I hadn’t had any since I was a little kid, but I’m glad that I did.
1	I’ve gotten the vaccine. It is perfectly safe lmao
0	I’ve had both shots and I feel so sick chest pains and feel literally like I’m dying it’s a year later now I’m scared the fphizer really gave me clots this is scary
0	I’ve had covid. So has my husband. I’d rather have it over and over again each year than take vaccine. I’m not okay with being lab rat for virus that has high recovery rate.
0	I’ve had dermatographia for a year and a half after the booster vaccine. I got it 11 day’s after so I guess I’m not as bad off as some but I know for a fact this isn’t good for everyone.
0	I’ve had loads of vaccines in my lifetime. The worst I ever felt, was a slightly unwell feeling for a few hours. Then I had the COVID vaccine….suffering from parathesia for over 2 months. And that’s what I’m aware of….
1	I’ve had my first dose of the oxford vaccine and can verify myself and family and friends who have had it had no serious side effects at all.
1	I’ve had one more vaccination than most due to a minor immune deficiency. No reaction. No one I know has had a reaction. And when I finally caught Covid, being vaccinated probably saved my life.
1	I’ve had three doses, as have all of my kids and coworkers, and no, no seizures, or any other effects.
1	I’ve received both of mine! It’s nice to know I can protect myself, my patients and my family.
0	I’ve seen Wolrd War Z, no thanks lmao
0	I’ve seen more strokes and heart attacks in older people than ever before. I know they’re of more risk but I work in Retirment villages and have noticed a huge increase I’ve been doing this work for 10 years. Both my grandparents have had heart issues in the last 12 months too.
1	I’ve taken the moderna vaccine. I’ve gone on multiple 5 plus mile runs since then and everything is fine so far. After my first dose I felt extremely fatigued for a couple of days but that’s it. I get my second dose on July 3rd.
1	Jesus fuck when did this sub turn into a cess pit of anti-vaxxers? These comments are pathetic
0	Just a realistic point of view from a vaccine hesitant person (I am currently studying to be a nurse btw so understand how vaccines work) While I agree with most of what he said I'm still going to wait out as long as I can getting the vaccine. I think he downplayed the fact that you are still able to transmit the virus after vaccination, the window of time is reduced a fraction still and also still being able to contract Covid after vaccination, given the vaccine isn't as effective on the delta strain. Overall this reduces the protection it offers. Also the long term effects. Not one person can 100% say it's completely safe, not doctors, scientists, microbiologists, pfizer or the government know for sure. That is a matter of time. As far as data being collected it looks promising but I'm still just going to roll with natural immunity if I should contract covid. We have an immune system for a reason. My whole family abroad has had it, all 23 and they managed to survive without bad affect..even my 89 year old grandmother..was a bit rough on her but she got through it. Anyone who says you'll turn into a lizard or it has microchips in the vaccine is just trolling that's not even a serious myth to debunk.
1	Just because it happened to one guy, it doesn't mean it'll happen to every one of us. How many people die from medications for other diseases? Why hasn't that been put out on the news?
1	Just because vaccines aren’t perfect doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not working.
1	Just finished my first shift volunteering at the local Covid-19 vaccination centre and I got vaccinated as well!
1	Just got mine right now! Feeling great.
1	Just got mine this week, no side effects except some pain in my shoulder but it's not that big of a deal, like i hit the door or something
1	Just got my first Pfizer vaccine and it was very easy, it’s impressive the efficiency and organization I’ve seen at several of these vaccination locations.
1	Just got my first dose this past Saturday, can't wait to get my second dose. One step closer to protecting my loved ones. (Age 28)
1	Just got my first dose today. My arm is sore but I'm happy.
1	Just got my first dose u should really get the shot
1	Just got my first!
1	Just got my second dose Sunday and all I got was a sore arm. The next day I felt just the sore arm and by night time I was good. The next day all normal. Just get it done you’ll be happy and glad you’re done with already. Yes I was skeptical at first but because i have a comorbidity I got it rather than get covid and have 10x worse
1	Just got my second!!
1	Just got my vaccine today, couldn't be more grateful and excited, so far so good
1	Just got the newest Covid shot and the flu vaccine. I feel better already. Next up: RSV.
1	Just had my first dose of Sinovac Vaccine yesterday and my left arm (where I was injected) felt sore the entire day and had a slight fever and headache. Apart from that, everything's great. Will have my 2nd dose on June 2nd.
1	Just had two days with high fever after my second Moderna shot. However, I won't complain, as I appreciate the privilege to receive this incredible high-tech product, which clearly initiated a strong immune reaction with the second dose.
0	Just ignore these murderers as God will have vengeance upon them, all that made profit off death of the innocent and stupid.
1	Just make the antivexxers sign a document saying they will pay for their own medical bills if they contract the virus. And the ventilators given priority to those that followed the protocol
1	Just scheduled my booster for tomorrow thanks to this post. I haven’t gotten a booster since December 2021 and had a mild case of Covid in summer 2022. Long overdue…
1	Just signed up for my first dose, but really anxious about the side effect of it making me sick as im a type 2 diabetic that already takes forever to get over sickness, but hoping for the best
1	Just want to say thanks for explaining this! This really puts those numbers into perspective. And it's good to know that despite the difference in the numbers, each vaccine is safe enough to keep me away from the hospital or death.
1	Karens: "tHeRE'S nOThIng nAtUraL aBOUt VAcINes!1!!11" Immune System: *does 80% of the work of a vaccine*
1	Keep it going Moderna and thank you. Completely agree we have an engineering problem. We need the military to take over once these products come off the production lines and deliver the shot - no pun intended.
1	Keep making those doses. Good work.
0	Keep your poison
0	LAB RAT VACCINE DEPOPULATON PROGRAMME !
0	LIES - I wonder if you both can be sued? Keeping this if a family or friend die after taking this POISON!
1	Lasts 3 times longer than natural immunity, wow, this is amazing progress
1	Less than 1 in a MILLION side effects which is less than aspririne, less than having a plane fall on your head and even less than eating common food
1	Let's appreciate and applaud the doctors for helping us all
1	Let's get vaccinated!
1	Let's hope it works out. I'd love to do some international traveling again.
1	Let's not forget the time people thought A&W's third pounder burgers had less meat than McD's quarter pounders. Numbers are hard for some people.
0	Let's see how the vaccinated do after weeks, months and years. It could come out over time that the mortality rate for the vaccine is higher than the virus.
1	Lethal disease: dies Anti-vaxxers: It's rewind time!
1	Let’s hope for the worlds sake that this is the beginning of the end of COVID.
0	Let’s never forget the politicians and medical professionals that forced people to take this poison.
0	Let’s take a moment of silence, for those of us who resisted, to thank our innate instinct to survive and our primal intuition for the warning of Danger Ahead.
0	Lies. All lies. We are NOT stupid, ignorant, nor uneducated. Stop speaking to us like we are.
1	Listen guys... I realize that some people have had adverse reactions to vaccines; but what you must realize is that it's generally a small minority of people that have any kind of severe reaction to a particular vaccine. If you weigh the benefits to the drawbacks, it just makes way more sense to get the vaccine, rather than risk getting Covid and having a severe reaction.
1	Literally just got my 2nd moderna shot 45 seconds ago! Woooo
1	Literally, just got my shot today.
0	Lol y’all go ahead and get the Covid booster I’ll pass on having heart problems
0	Lol, well you sure rushed the first batch of poison through didn’t ya
1	Love science!
1	Love the real information about why vaccinating people is a positive thing for us humans. This is actual research and not people assuming vaccination prevents COVID, it doesn’t. I still stand with people having their personal decision regarding the vaccine.
1	Love the vaccines. I think people should be encouraged to take as many as they can hand;e and boosters when they are available This is a great channel I heard that every doctor in the uk and every person working for the nhs and government and all the MP’s have had the vaccine and they’ve declared it publicly. (But I can’t find the website which shows this) So it’s obviously safe Thanks for sharing
0	MRNA vaccines have been tried and tested on animals for years, there was severe side effects on the animals, these vaccines were rushed trough the testing process...no MRNA vaccines for me thank you.
0	MY BODY MY Choice. Forcing this is threatening a war on Humans.
1	Mail it to me.
0	Man I can't wait until I get this mysterious poison injected into my arm! It will save me from that virus that I haven't seen one person suffer from
1	Man imagine being one of those kids that never paid attention in high school and now thinks that all science is fake and that this vaccine is some brainwashing poison made by the government. Crazy what happens when kids are raised to not respect nor value the exact science meant to keep them alive longer.
1	Mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations are the way to go. Maximum suppression is the best approach to isolate this virus, and the only way to make it safe to reopen schools from kindergarten through college.
0	Many companies’ vaccines have been revealed to be defective
0	Many who will do their own research will never fool with vaccines ....
0	Masks don’t work, COVID vaccines don’t prevent transmission
0	May have adverse reactions
0	Maybe moderna can tell us about the mice that died during the SARS COV -1 mRNA trials? And maybe a follow up question to see if they studied second time covid-19 exposure post injection because im just confused that they weren't concerned about all the mice dieing upon second contact of sars cov-1 after injection.
0	Maybe someday, there will be a safe and effective Covid vaccine… but for now, I wouldn’t touch that damn stuff with a 10 foot pole.
0	Maybe we have this misery BECAUSE of masking and vaccination.
1	Me and my whole office did Sputnik-V. Half a year later no problem so far!
0	Me, my wife and 4 kids are all unvaccinated. I lost my job at the airport & our oldest 17 year old daughter lost her part-time job at McDonalds. I guess we still have our health ..... Cheers from New Zealand
1	Medical personnel everywhere support getting vaccinated for COVID.
0	Mmm for someone to say that vaccines are completely safe they are 100% liars because no medication or man made product is 100%
1	Moderna side effects are rough, but I ll take it over catching Covid-19 again. It sucks big time!!
0	Moderna stock prices will be held up as long as they need to be for you to keep investors happy so yeah it's "safe"
1	More good mRNA news!
0	Most of history for thousands of years not 1 vaccine existed. So mankind never needed them to survive. Most Spanish speakers are Native Americans proving you don't need vaccines to survive viral plagues.
0	My 15 year old granddaughter has a heart condition DIRECTLY related to the vaccine given by the school without asking us.
0	My Grandmother died of a heart attack after getting booster shots in ‘21.. I talked to her about being sure if she wanted to do it.. if it was healthy and right for her. .I miss her so and I truly believe it had a hand in her passing. Love you Mawmaw.
0	My adult daughter got the Pfizer vax, first jab, didn’t feel well for several days, booster, ended up in the ER. Blood clots, extreme fatigue were among the most serious side effects. A month and a half later the fatigue is still a serious problem.
0	My anti vax GP told me about this a few weeks ago, I found it incredible and hard to believe. Now I know she was simply doing her job of investigating instead of just trusting government propaganda. I'm blessed to have such a great Dr.
0	My aunt just got the second moderna and is feeling pain from head to toe.
1	My baby got his first Covid vaccine today and I feel like such a weight has been lifted!
0	My best friends dad died the following morning after receiving a vaccine. DO NOT PUT THIS EXPERIMENTAL POISON IN YOUR BODY!
0	My body, my choice, and I'm not even trying to delete an unborn innocent.
1	My brother caught it (unvaccinated) and gave it to me (breakthrough - I'm double vaccinated). I had a head cold. My brother ended up in the hospital and died from covid pneumonia. I have asthma and diabetes.
0	My brother got vaccinated he never been the same ever since he keep on feeling tired and body pain frequent headaches he was a construction worker before he got vaccinated after the vaccine he said his strength is not the same it hard for him to do hard work
1	My brother had (predicted) complications from his measles vaccine (and other vaccines) as a kid, but he had a somewhat underdeveloped immune system in his early childhood, so if he'd gotten actual measles, he would've likely died. He got a fever for a few days and was groggy for a while. Nothing else happened, except he didn't get sick from these horrible diseases. And he was somewhat of a worst-case-scenario and he's fine. Now he's 20 and healthy. Vaccinate your kids, peeps, or they may not make it as far as he did.
0	My children and I have all had our vaccines but my children or myself will not get the covid vaccine
0	My condolences to all those who got the vaccine.. We will miss you
0	My cousin contacted me to say her husband's friend died shortly after being vaccinated enough said
0	My coworker just took the covid vaccine and his lungs immediately filled with liquid. He couldn’t breathe the next day and had to go to the emergency room. The doctor put him in a medically induced coma for 5 days to drain the fluid and now he has permanent lung damage.
1	My dad almost died after getting his Covid shot. He was hospitalized then eventually moving to a retirement home. He lost the ability to walk after being bedridden for so many months. Doctors were quick to deny that the shot had anything to do with it. They were quick to change the subject too
0	My dad died of encephalitis after his second shot
1	My dad over age 60 is scheduled to get a vaccine within weeks, we'll get it later due to eligibility.
0	My dad works in an assisted living facility where covid vaccines were administered to every resident. Within 5 days of giving vaccines, 3 residents died. All were physically heathy. The facility, state, and vaccine company refuse to say the vaccine had anything to do with it. No media coverage either. There is massive silencing of covid vaccine related deaths around the world.
1	My dad’s friend is unvaccinated and has gotten COVID three times…The first time he was hospitalized. He has numerous comorbidities and has suffered from long COVID. You’d think three times is enough to convince you to vaccinate, but I guess not.
0	My daughter and I never got it. No vaccine either.
0	My exhusbands father just died 2 weeks after getting his 2nd shot. I'm good. I do not need to get the shot. I wear a mask and stay out of big public places. Take vitamins people... Stay safe!!!
1	My family already fully vaccine and no problems safety Pfizer
0	My family and I don't believe of the vaccine !! So we pass !! We will never take them nooooooo wayyyyyy !!!!!
0	My family doctor died two days after Covid 19 vaccine but they said his heart attack was not related.
1	My family got the boosters. It saved us. Being immunocompromised is nothing to play around with.
0	My family is fully vaccinated but as for this experimental vaccine we're not going to take it yet we're young enough that we will survive if we get the virus and if it's safe we'll take it in the future
1	My family will all get vaccinated hoping that if enough people do that we can still halt this thing. Covid is evolving, if we don't halt it's spread, we will be facing something worse.
0	My favorite famous boxer Marvin Hagler, who has stronger body than a German Panzer, has just died today after receiving the covid-19 vaccine
1	My first jab of the Moderna I had a sore arm for a couple of days. My second jab of the Moderna I felt like I had been run over by a truck. Well, maybe by a small child driving a go-cart. It was unpleasant, but not brutal. And I would do it again knowing what was coming.
0	My friend developed myocarditis after her second jab. She is thirty nine!
1	My friend made fun of me for wearing a mask and my fear about covid. He got covid including his family. He got cured but His father died. His whole family under depression for months. Now they started again being ignorant. There is no cure for stupidity
0	My friend's father, usually a healthy man. Got fully vaccinated. He then had a triple bypass, then his memory was fading. Doctors said it was a stroke and Guillaume barre. He's now having to relearn how to walk and do everyday things.
0	My girl has been losing her hair ever since she got the shot. Do not get it
0	My goodness I hope nobody is vaccinating their kids anymore. I hope everyone is aware and awake. It is not for your benefit. Believe in your gut instinct. If somebody Hass to talk you into something it’s not good.
0	My grandmother is refusing to get the this time. 91 years old. She says “if I die, I die”
1	My household are fully vaccinated.
1	My husband and I are seniors. We have 4 children who have been thankfully vaccinated. None of our grandchildren have been. Two of our grandchildren have had Covid. They say they have antibodies and don’t need the vaccine!!! One is a travelling RN and does not want to be vaccinated. One is getting married and his future wife and he are not getting vaccinated. This is very disturbing. We will be masked at the wedding for our safety. The article is so informative and I will send it along to everyone including our entire family.
1	My husband and I were just boosted last week. Thank God we were. He tested positive for Covid early this week. It’s going around his workplace. He’s felt fine. Vaccines work!
1	My husband, my Dad, and I are getting our first vaccination tomorrow. We are happy to get it.
0	My immune system will be my protection.
0	My kids will never get one
0	My lawyer was fully vaccinated and died of covid.
1	My mom (75), my partner and i (42) all got the pfizer. Tired the day after but that was it.
0	My mom had 2 jabs and 5 boosters, she also had Covid 7 times and Long Covid,once and she believes that the vaccine is why she has gotten more mild Covid. right now she has a bad flu not Covid for the 2ND time.. I just nod and agree as to not upset her but she has been in quarantine for years now.
1	My mom has done the same thing. Anti vaccine, gets COVID and loses taste, pro vaccine. I’m hoping they’ll finally let me get it. (I’m 16)
0	My mom said that I am one in a million, so, I'm opting out of cvid 19 vaccinations.
0	My mother died from a heart attack a few months ago after she took the vaccine. She’s never had cardiovascular problems in her life.
0	My mother got 1st shot of Pfizer hours later ----- same day had a stroke
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots.
1	My mother is 98 years old. She has taken 4 shots and is just as healthy now as she was when she took the first shot. This woman is a nut.
0	My mother took this vaccine on 3rd April and today is 9th she is covid positive
0	My mother-in-law was a healthy woman until she got vaccinated and the boosters now she's completely lost her eyesight in one eye and has other health problems now.
0	My mothers arm went numb after her first shot and she refuses to get second. A guys at works wife lost all her hair ....? Like are we just not hearing about some of these side effects cause they are forcing this on us.
0	My natural antibodies are the vaccine! I’m not taking anything that isn’t approved or tested on humans for a long period of time.
1	My opinion on the covid vaccine is "I won't be the first in line for the vaccine, but I will be in line."
1	My parents all grew up during the 50s/60s. They all knew multiple families that lost children to measles. I was pretty much vaccinated for anything they could get me for and I am perfectly healthy. Vaccinate your children, it saves lives.
1	My rabid anti-vaxxer cousin has persuaded her nearly 80YO mother not to get her boosters. My aunt recently had a stroke. My cousin thinks she's doing the right thing. The misinformation leads to insanity.
0	My respect to all those that refuse this poison.
1	My respond whenever a person who choose to not be vaccinated passes away from covid: oh no. Anyway, back to cute cat videos
1	My second shot is tomorrow (26yo). I also have booked a flight three weeks after that to visit my parents just in time for Dad's birthday!! I have been feeling great relief for being partially immune, and can't imagine how much relief I'm gonna feel tomorrow, and how much more relief I'll feel 2 weeks after (when my adaptive immune system has had time to make more antibodies and memory cells, causing the full 95% immunity)
1	My sister had a reaction to a vaccine and can't get certain ones. She's still pro-vaccine
0	My sister in law had several strokes after her first booster. She was the healthier member of our family and in her early 50’s. She said she had felt different after the shots. I’m grateful I never got vaccinated. Bummed that two of my kids did get vaccinated
0	My sister is going through horrific symptoms after taking the covid vax. She tried to tell us what was happening, but we didn’t believe her until her symptoms got so bad, we were able to finally see what was happening! It’s horrifying to watch a beautiful, vibrant business woman, turn into a zombie-like creature. Dementia symptoms, uncontrollable jerking, tremors, tics. She has difficulty eating and drinking. No vax for me after seeing her like this!!
1	My sister was tired and had head aches, but my aunt and uncle had it really hard. They said this was hard I don’t want to imagine the real deal.. so glad we all get vaxed
0	My sister works for one of these biotech companies that make the vaccine and she said it's all about the money.
0	My sisters health has drastically declined after the Pfizer vaccine. Her symptoms became so debilitating that she is currently admitted and under observation for the past 3 days. She stopped eating 2 weeks ago and barely talks now. She’s in a complete state of confusion. Before the jab, she was perfectly healthy. No one wants to talk about the sinister reality that’s occurring to all of humanity! Prayers for her are requested! Y’all do your research PLEASE!
0	My son in lays friend in his 30s died 3 days later, my niece got the vaccine and shortly after was diagnosed with MDS Leukemia, she is only 37, most who get that are in their 60s or older. This is very concerning. Her platelets we're way down after the vaccine too
0	My son says so many of his health problems stem from all the vaccines he got in the Navy!
0	My uncle died of a bloodclot in the brain after 2nd dose. After 1st dose he became ill and suffered from fatigue. He never tested positive for covid so our family all refused vaccine as we all recovered from virus without bs vaccines. RIP Eric
0	My uncle had two doses of Covid a month later he passed away.
0	My uncle took the Moderna shot on Friday March 12. He started feeling bad within 30 minutes. He died within 4 hours.
0	My understanding is you do not actually get immunity from this injection and it is not actually a vaccine...it is experimental gene therapy. No long term studies and never before used in humans....
0	My vaccine is Jesus Christ
1	My whole family and I had our vaccine. Slight headache and fatigue first dose of Pfizer but felt completely fine the 2nd dose. I recommend NOT to get the doses in the same arm! That will keep you from having the swelling or irritation. My peace of mind is something I haven't felt since this pandemic started...some actual hope and protection. Don't be afraid. You will be fine and you will feel so much better and the peace of mind alone is worth it.
1	My wife and I both got the COVID vaccine as soon as we could.
0	My wife had to get vaxxed to keep her job. Now she can’t work because of the side effects. Please pray for us
1	My wife was fully vaccinated and I got covid(very mild symptoms) and we quarantined at our apartment and she never tested positive.
1	Myself and 9 other family members went together and got these shots. None of us have had any problems.
0	NEVER would I put that Fauci sauce in my arm let alone my child’s
0	NO COVID 19 HERE IN BURUNDI. WE ARE ALL WELL AND SAFE, EVEN THOSE WHO ARE COMING FROM ABROAD ONCE THEY REACH HERE THEY ARE COVERED WITHIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS, SO, THERE IS NO NEED TO BRING THIS SATANIC VACCINE. AWAY FROM US IN THE NAME OF JESUS.
0	NOT going to take this man's advice. No thank you. And NONE of these people have the RIGHT to force ANOTHER person to put something INTO their body that they do NOT want.
0	Nah I'll skip that
0	Nah.. nah..nah.. vaccine sounds so creepy to me, Boost Your own Immune System Peoples !!!
0	Nazarin is wise beyond her years. Never take anything that has not had years of testing and "learn as we go" is the response to logical questions.
0	Nazarin, thank you! I lost my Mom and Dad both, within 8 months after they both took the shots. Both were pretty healthy before and my Dads heart stopped, and my poor Mother, suddenly got Cancer, everywhere! The lady blames it on our "emotions ".. Its just like you said, we KNOW what happened.. Were not stupid. I miss my Mom so much, and i wish i could have been there to stop them from taking those shots!
1	Nearly all the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are also ingredients in many foods – fats, sugars, and salts.So,It's absolutely safe.
0	Needing a booster every couple of months shows how shady this is, it feels like it is making the body dependent rather than independent
0	Neither safe nor effective. Enjoy your Poison.
0	Never again! Regretting that I got vaccinated in the first place, but won’t ever (!) repeat that mistake again!
0	Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying “we didn’t know the harm they could cause”. We knew - they knew.
0	Never ever forgot the pressure from media and government and thus the vaccinated public who treated those who choose not to take this like utter garbage.
0	Never forget, they emotionally blackmailed the children for use as paper shields, to "save" Grandma.
0	Never getting the mRNA shot.
0	Never got the vaccine and still not getting it. I also don't get the flu shots.
1	Never had Covid, vaxxed to the hilt, wear a mask when in close contact with others. Maybe I just have a really good immune system. I consider myself fortunate. I don’t like being sick, and I damn sure don’t want any long Covid symptoms. I’m so grateful for the vaccine.
1	Never in my wildest imagination would I have thought that a deadly virus could target a certain mindset....lol
0	Never known so many people with stroke, heart attack, cancer, copd, blood clots, repeat Covid infection, and liver failure in my life. They all have one thing in common. I’m glad I knew what was going on and didn’t succumb to the pressure. I think in the coming years we will see it’s so much more widespread than anyone can imagine.
0	Never took it. Don't regret it at all! Sorry for those that did! Can't believe we are still pushing that mess!
0	Never will I ever get that vaccine LOL
0	Never you don't need them, just eat healthy and exercise, simple
0	New technology that's barely been tested, and the manufacturer refusing to take responsibility if things go wrong. I'm definitely not taking it
1	Nice video, it's gave so much of relief..now in India second wave is at peak, thousands of death daily.... I got vaccinated with covidsheild....feeling better after watching your video....I am safe... even I get infected after vaccination... No risk of hospitalization of death.... Thank you Nicely explained beautiful animation
1	Nice, still gonna wait a little bit after its available to take it myself.
0	No Vaxxination, no Problems.
0	No Vaxxination, no Problems. :)
0	No healthy person under 60 needs this vaccine
0	No liability for the manufacturers. Why anyone would play the lottery with their life is beyond me.
0	No long term safety data, no vaccine for me.
0	No more Covid vaccine for me! I’ve had three doses and still got Covid19 three times and each had severe symptoms .. No, thank you! Not falling to that trap again!
1	No negative effects please get vaccinated
0	No no no – we have been the Guinea pigs and people are dying of blood clots and more as more evidence comes out. I had three shots reluctantly but no more.
0	No one governs or tells me what to put in my body. Full stop.
0	No one is forcing me to take that poison.
0	No one is injecting this poison into my system.
0	No one regrets not getting it. Many regrets getting it. Thats all we need to know...
0	No one wants or needs this. Stop!
0	No one would listen when my chiropractor warned us. A brilliant lady who practices natural medicine.
0	No thank you.
0	No thanks , I don’t want myocarditis
0	No thanks - the vaccine is more dangerous than covid for me
0	No thanks I’ll stick to vitamins and orange juice
0	No thanks i watched a lot of people die from that shot including a friend, and coworker.
0	No thanks.
0	No vaccine for aids, cancer, but in one year y'all have vaccine for covid
0	No vaccine for me
0	No way I'm taking this poison there going to have to force me or arrest me.
0	No way am I getting hurt by Flu vaccines again! No jab for me!
0	No way in hell I'll ever take the jab!
0	No way will I get this vaccine.
0	No you can’t force me and you will not! I will get a different job if my employer mandates it, which they are about to, so I’m already looking at the many backup options.
0	No, I have no regrets for not poisoning myself. That's the best answer.
0	No, I wont take it for sure! I don’t believe that this ‘virus’ is as deadly as they say firstly. Secondly the ‘vaccine’ is of no use at all.
0	Nope enjoy you side effect crap
0	Norwegian officials said 23 people had died in the country a short time after receiving their first dose of the vaccine.
0	Not "vaccinated', never will be. Particularly as I personally know 3 people who had severe heart problems after being "vaccinated", and one died.
0	Not JABBED NOW OR WILL EVER BE JABBED, I DONT CARE WHAT WAS APPROVED
1	Not according to a guy I work with. He saw a website where a guy discovered something nefarious that every other scientist and doctor on earth missed.
0	Not all of us are simple minded sheep like special interests were hoping.
0	Not clear on why the aches and pains show up - analogy of no pain no gain doesn't cut it based on your own description of what it does - also what kind of nano particles are being used youvrather glossed over thst part?
0	Not enough time for data
0	Not for me thanks, I’ll keep my own unaltered immune system.
0	Not going anywhere near that hospital, even if my life depends on it.
0	Not in my body, let everybody else be guinea pigs..
0	Not putting that crap in my body
1	Nothing terrifies me more than seeing the increasing amount of cavemen who are against science. I expect at least 14 replies about why I should be as well. I can't wait
0	Notice how that Woman tried to gaslight that young Woman. The only ones pushing that jab, are malignant narcissists!
0	Notice that YouTube has kept this on top of the list for a full week, when you search "covid". They're making sure you get programmed to accept this.
0	Now I know why the CDC bought those disposable coffins for. They're stashed all over North America. Those who have taken it are gonna drop like crazy.
1	Now if only the conspiracy theorists actually cared about facts.
0	Now lets watch the NHS get really overwhelmed with the side effect patients from the vaccine
0	Now that we have medical journals especially the one from dr asheem malhotra...do the interviewer admit it is very likely the vax is the cause of the seizure etc?? Be honest...we all will be responsible for things that we do and say...
1	Now watch as I have absolutely no sympathy for those who choose not to get vaccinated!
1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types! 🤣
1	Number 2 baby! Arm already sore #Vaccinate
1	Nursing homes and other residential institutions need to keep up on vaccines and boosters.
1	Odd, as a man living with HIV for 23 years, and vaccinated twice plus two boosters, my T Cells were just tested and were by far the highest they've been in 15 years. One might almost think Sherry Tenpenny is lying.
0	Of course it won’t hurt you immediately duh. The side effects kicks in later.
1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe. But here's the kicker: No medicine is!! They all have side effects, some more severe than others. It is always(!) a question whether the pros outweigh the cons.
1	Of course.Most of all to be a patriot and protect all other humans.
0	Oh please, you want to give more people heart attacks?
0	Oh yes must listen to the WHO. Owned by Bill Gates and both will profit heavily from these BS shots. Do your own research folks. There never was a pandemic. Look up total deaths by year for any country and the proof is right there. Total deaths in the US for example went down from 2019 to 2020. How exactly does that work during a “pandemic” it’s all about money, power, and control.
1	Ok I’m thankful for this video, I was scared to get the covid vaccine because of the rumors but I get it now
1	Ok so i am from India and for those who have no idea it's because of aggressive vaccine drives our country is free from polio and yaws. Smallpox is non existent now . Due to BCG now many don't suffer from tuberculosis . Vaccines have been boon to us. If u live in a first world privileged society with none of our tropical diseases u should be thankful. If u are anti vax u are nothing but ignorant. Yes risks are always their but trust me u don't want to suffer from polio , smallpox or tb , you have no idea how debilitating those conditions are .
1	Once a year! Vaccinate
1	Once again #GetVaccinated #GetVaccinated #GetVaccinated
0	Once the insurance companies have to start paying for these vaccines then you'll see some real medical investigation
0	One doctor in Florida died after the vaccine but of course you won’t hear about it
0	One of my relatives developed pericarditis three days after taking 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. He was absolutely healthy previously and he is in his early twenties. Kaiser doctors at the beginning were trying to deny any connection to vaccine. He was several times in and out of the hospital now and finally they admitted that it's related to vaccine. Also, my mother-in -law developed bone cancer after the "shot". My sister in law's mother just passed away after her cervical cancer returned after long remission after the "shot". My other's sister-in-law father developed severe heart issue also right after the shot, to the point that he is dying now. Of course, they are all older people, but what is striking is the timing of this. I have not taken the shot, neither my child and nor my husband because 10 years ago when we took swine flu vaccine we all got severe side effects, and that is why we did not take any covid shots. My husband developed stroke then ( absolutely healthy 36 year old), I almost died from Guillain-Barre syndrome , my child developed severe neuropathy, and my husbands uncle had a heart attack. Again coincidence? I was very healthy before the flu shot, and now I am almost disabled. I did regain some of my health after the Guillain Barre , but I am still have severe residual symptoms. I am a microbiologist and have also medical background and I would never take another vax even if threatened. It is a poison, you might not believe me and think it is just all some kind of conspiracy nonsense , but I hope you will heed the warning! Lot of smart people, scientists and doctors spoke against it, but the censorship is very live and strong on YT
1	One of the things I liked about the vaccine is I felt like shit for 24 hours after the booster, but then when I did catch COVID I was neither hospitalized, nor did I die. I’ve often regarded feeling unwell for 24 hours as better than dying.
0	One thing about being a so called conspiracy theorist is that I will not have to worry about any of the side effects
0	One thing to remember is once anything is shot into your body, you can't later change your mind and undo it.
0	Only 30 percent of Americans want to vaccine. The demand will drop soon enough
1	Only in America would people protest against getting a vaccine that would protect you and your family from a virus.
0	Only trusting in the Lord.
1	Out of all the people I know that got vaccinated, it was safe and quick for them
0	Over 900% increase in heart failure. Happy Holidays
0	PUREBLOODED AND 100% GRATEFUL FOR NOT GETTING THE CLOT SHOT.
1	Parents not permitting vaccines is child abuse.
0	People are dying from the vaccines! Lord help us
0	People are foolish to get this vaccine unless they have underlying health issues that make the risks worth it.
1	People are going to get it - but if you can avoid it being all at once, it helps tremendously. THIS IS AWESOME to help explain to children and teens, especially. Thank you!!
1	People are so stupid nowdays, I can't believe random people in the comment section think they know any better than medical professionals that went through extensive education for 12+ years and spent even more time in this field.
0	People are still dying , also getting side effects from the jab.
0	People are waking up. After my cousin's son had his shots he completely changed. They gave him more shots than he was due because he had been sick and was behind. I know it was the vaccine that changed my baby cousin forever no one can tell me different
0	People die because of it. The last one I know of is the doctor who got the vaccine and died 16 days later. So for me no thank you
0	People died already and other waiting tried to survive.
0	People in Australia who had severe reactions to the first vaccine were still MANDATED to get the second. In Victoria it was even worse because they mandated the third for a long list of industries. Even if the first or second nearly killed you, you had to go back for more. The level of criminality responsible for this level of decision making still staggers me.
1	People need to get vaccinated!
1	People who are unvaccinated are 97 times more likely to die from covid than those fully vaccinated with a booster!! Get your free, easy to find vaccines today!
1	People who don't get vaccinated are not only endangering themselves, but those around them. Highly irresponsible.
1	People who refuse the vaccine should have to pay private for COVID treatment. These anti vax morons are so thick I doubt they can spell their own name without deep, deep thought.
1	People who refuse to get vaccinated are like people who refuse to wash their hands after using the restroom.
0	People who refuse to take the vaccine are the 21st century Rosa Parks.
1	Personal anecdote. Been getting all the shots/boosters. Got some bug that I'm positive was covid June of 2023. Took about a month for the constant coughing to come to a complete stop. Got it again December, but recovered much much quicker this time around. I think the main difference is that it'd only been 2 months since I got the latest booster, so my immunity was much better prepared.
0	Pfizer has no liability, and they are immune from prosecution. Let that sink in.
0	Pfizer mrna is dangerous god bless natural immunity
0	Pharma Industry = Big Scammers
0	Phase 3 trials won’t be completed until 2023 so are we the test subjects?
1	Planning on getting my vaccine shot really soon!
1	Please announce early as possible that vaccine is free far all please.
1	Please do a story on the communities that have successfully kept covid out and the organisations that helped make that happen. In Germany, one of the poorest states also has the highest rate of vaccination thanks to social workers doing the footwork, talking to community leaders, religious leaders, and bringing mobile vaccine stations to the neighbourhoods. There has to be a success story in the US somewhere
0	Please folks...do not take this experimental death serum.
1	Please get it. We want this pandemic to end so we can work on the next crisis.
1	Please get vaccinated and safe yourself and orhers
1	Please get vaccinated. Vaccines aren't political. Although this one is not 100% perfect, it will keep you out of the hospital with near certainty.
0	Please save us from people who claim to care about our health at the same time medically rape us thru injection filling us with POISON
0	Poison vaccines
0	Pray for those who took these shots
1	Prevention is the Best Medicine
1	Protect yourself and protect others. Every shot counts. Congrats, you're doing the right thing.
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now.
1	Proud to have had both my shots. I know I can still get it but chances are it won't kill me.
0	Proudly unvaccinated and 100% immune to adverse vaccine effects. Alliance Against Myocarditis!
0	Proudly unvaccinated. Y’all were flat out brainwashed. Me? I stayed strong. Had my money saved. When my job laid me off for not taking that jab, I was ready. I had over 3 years of rent saved up. I was living good for the past 2 in half years. Get ya priorities straight.
0	Pure blood and nothing is changing that..
0	Pure blood and very proud of it!
0	Pushing a vaccine for a virus with a high recovery rate? And not Health? Shameful!
1	Rather than attempting to shame those who've been offered the vaccine, support and encourage them. After all, as more people get vaccinated, the better it will be for everyone--including you.
1	Received my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday and besides a little injection site pain I’ve felt no symptoms.
1	Received my first Pfizer Vaccine yesterday evening, woke up with nothing but a sore arm, fatigue and a slight headache. Nothing a little over the counter medicine won't help! Definitely prefer these symptoms vs the alternative!
1	Receiving the vaccine has given me a renewed sense of freedom and the ability to engage in activities I once took for granted.
1	Recently diagnosed but have had signs and epilepsy for years. I have always taken vaccines when they were recommended and always will. We believe in science and our responsibility to protect others as much as possible. Still wear a mask every time we go out.
0	Regret. I felt horrible after my second moderna shot.
1	Remember that time you got polio? Oh thats right, it never happened because your parents got you fucking vaccinated!
0	Remember, you still have to wear your mask if you're vaccinated 🤡
0	Reminder, the jabs don’t work. 6 million Israelis stopped taking them. It can be assumed that the vast majority of them were harmed in one way or another. It was forced on people after only two months of a fake experiment with hidden data and a questionable emergency approval.
1	Researchers determine that vaccinated children are less likely to infect adults
0	Run. Like fast. From this injection.
1	Sadly if you do not believe the science on the Covid vaccine, you cannot believe the science on diabetes, stroke, heart attacks, appendicitis, etc. Best to be your own doctor & not take any of those meds or surgical interventions that might help. Yes?
1	Sadly, the anti-vax infectivists and the CDC-haters have arrived to promote their anti-vax disinformation. Modern vaccines have been proven safe. And yes, all vaccines are indeed vaccines. Don't allow yourself to be bamboozled by these nitwits, spewing their anti-vax malarkey.
0	Safely vaccinated? How on earth has any long term safety data been compiled? The only thing that's accumulating is wealth in the pockets of the already-super-rich.
0	Same thing happened to me, my blood was 10 times thinner, I had a massive headache and pnuemonia to boot. All after 2nd shot. Never again.
0	Same time next year I will still be VACCINE FREE!
0	Say NO NO NO to getting the vaccine.
0	Say no to vaccine ,vaccine does not work on korona.
0	Say no to vaccines!!!!
0	Say, “No way Jose” to the vaccine!
0	Saying these injections are safe is like saying politicians don't lie.
1	Says not being an antivaxer by any means. Immediately starts to talk about numerous claims without any reference to any scientific sources. Next uses anecdotal evidence to sew doubt. Uses personal experiences to further increase the doubt and uses 'gut feeling' as a suggestion of proof, again without any real proof any of OP's symptoms are actually related to the vaccine.
1	Science is real!!!!!
0	Scientific evidences? Who provides scientific evidences? The same that sell you the vaccine :-) Hahahaha
0	Seeing as I am doing fine two years in and have Covid antibodies......I think my decision not to vax was THE RIGHT DECISION.
0	Seems that everyone i know that had the shot have had more and worse Covid symptoms than me and my immediate family who didn't, and for a significant minority far worse side effects.
1	Sent this video to an "I'll do it later" friend, now his first appointment is tomorrow at 10 :)
0	Shaking my head again. I never would have had the vaccine (2 doses) if I would have known this. Thank you for all you do, Dr. Campbell.
0	She is so confident that the science and statistical data is flawless when the science and statistical information has been skewed or incorrect this entire time. She needs to be more open minded to the possibility that these negative side effects might be happening at a much larger rate than what is being reported.
0	She said "very rare side effects" but every where you can read stories of people who are now in bad shape after the jab.
1	Shock horror. You mean the antivaxxers were wrong?
0	Short answer, no.
1	Show me the scientific data to back up the idea that the vaccine doesn't help prevent COVID or doesn't make the symptoms less severe.
0	Simply because it's not a cure. It's an experimental gene therapy jab. It doesn't matter if you have it or not makes no sense.
1	Since I treat COVID patients three days a week, totally worth it.
0	Since it is not mandatory, I can skip
0	Since number of Covid cases have been reduced,no need of a vaccine
0	Since the start of pandemic. I never had any fever and flu even pre pandemic. Not until i had vaccinated with first dose of pfizer last week. The side effects took after 6 days from my vacvination. And its the worst ever. Im even thinking not getting my 2nd dose.
0	Since vax I have had the most extreme fatigue, depleted immune system and constant colds
1	Since when did anti-vaxxers believe in evidence?
0	Sir I'm so much scarred to take vaccine
0	Sister in law, who works as a carer, was over at Xmas and said to me they never ever said the vaccine would prevent infection or transmission which I quickly disproved with the help of YouTube.
1	Smart people get vaccinated
0	So all the old people who died within 28 days of a faulty test definitely died of covid but those old people who died after the vaccine definitely didn't die of the vaccine. Ok.
0	So basically you are using the public as guinea pigs
0	So glad I never got the booster
1	So glad I’m not anti vax nothing happened to me getting all of them
0	So glad I’m not going to be taking the vaccine.
0	So glad my wife convinced me not to get the shot I would be stressing now
1	So happy to have had my first covid vaccine
0	So if i die from vaccine it,that doesnt matter as long as i am protecting others by taking something that might kill me??
1	So if i have 4 doses and my last was in September 10 can i take a new one, i mean the fifth dose?
0	So let's see same shots same outcomes same problems same injuries same medical conditions same autism but vaccines no connection LOL
0	So rare yet EVERYONE knows someone that's had problems with the jab. The fact that they aren't being documented and the truth is being hidden just further supports my decision
0	So sad my parents got all four vaccines
1	So sad to see the people saying no to the vaccine when they barely have an understanding of medicine.
0	So when I say, "y'all are guinea pigs, don't get mad. For y'all taking that poison. Fat meat is greasy, and sugar is sweet. Can't say ya wasn't warned.
0	So you Knowillingly are injecting the public with toxic poison then?
0	So, when someone dies before vaccination, it’s due to COVID-19 and something must be done to prevent it; but when they die after vaccination, they die of natural causes and no preventative action is necessary...interesting.
1	So....just like all the other perfectly safe routine vaccines we've been getting for years until a bunch of hippies and conservative pot-stirrers told people they were unsafe and now we have measles outbreaks
0	Some employers are making it mandatory to get it or be fired. I would have to be fired, cause I'm not getting it.
0	Some side effects are normal like death
0	Something similar happened in my family. The vaccine isn't for everyone.
0	Something that nobody knows about
1	Sometimes I just open tik tok and see an antivaxxer and just close it out cause I’m not ready to start the day off with it.
0	Sorry no vaccines here for me and my family not happening were passing on it won't be no side affects here were not taking it
0	Sorry our human rights have been stripped away, fuck the jabs
1	Sorry, but my conservative aunt who did her own research on Facebook said this is a lie. She said Covid vaccines have a microchip that tracks you!
1	Sounds useful. Reliable protection for people willing to get the vaccine sounds great. As for antivax cranks, they're gambling with other people's lives and I am long since out of sympathy.
0	Stand strong! No vaccine.
1	Stay safe, and get a COVID vaccine as soon as you can.
0	Stick yourselves we are out. THE PEOPLE
0	Still haven't gotten one, and still never will.
0	Still never taking this poison shot 🖕
0	Still no jab for me or my family
0	Still not putting that shit in my arm.
0	Still not touching it with a barge pole - sorry! Have done too much research of my own. See the research of Celeste Solum and Deborah Tavares of Stop the Crime.Net for the truth.
0	Still scared to get the vaccine though. What if it genetically modifies my cell and gives me cancer or something like that
1	Stop panicking the word here is "rare"! As for the people not now going to have the Vaccine because of this risk, do you or your partner still take the contraceptive pill? As that is known to also cause blood colts!! Everything runs a risk!
1	Such a fantastic video, thank you! I get really emotional thinking about how much we are capable of solving huge problems if we really put our minds to it. Very grateful to all the scientists, researchers, health workers, and so many more people, who have put in such a tremendous amount of hard work into developing and distributing vaccines in record time.
1	Such a sad situation. Get the f-king vaccine. Don’t be a smart-ass.
0	Such lies! It’s all toxic crap injected into your body- which will bring about unhealthy side effects! It’s so sad seeing the world buying into governmental mind bending world alternating facts. The truth is out there people but you need to use your God given brain!
1	Super interesting science behind all this, watching molecular machinery at work is fascinating.
1	Sure hope there is a great cure fer it an hopefully there isnt anymore coming . it is a real bad thing . Stay home everyone if you can please.
1	Sweet I get my second dose Friday!
0	Swine flu vaccine has caused narcolepsy in a good few people in Ireland, recent case settled linked below. There wasn't nearly as much pressure (or profit to be had) to be first to market with that vaccine compared to that of Covid now. I'd definitely be slightly hesitant to be first in line for a Covid vaccine.
0	THE VAX IS KILLING HEALTHY PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW IT.
0	THIS Genocide Vaccination MUST BE STOPPED!!!
0	THIS IS NOT RIGHT. You can't force this apon people. Stand up for your rights people
1	Take the vaccine or don’t take it. Just stay tf away from those us that value our lives enough get vaccinated, if not only for us, but also the people we care about. STFU with lying azz conspiracy theories and leave us alone.
0	Take the vaccine then the real health problems begin. These sheep never learn.
1	Take your boosters and take them often.
1	Take your vaccines folks. Do anti-vaxxers not know how vaccines work? They're made with a weaker strain of a disease with the purpose of teaching your immune system how to deal with the disease. And that means a quicker recovery (generally) if you get sick as then your body already knows how to respond to it. Do you really want to jeapordize your and others health by refusing vaccines and telling others to do so too?
1	Take your vaccines, they will protect you
1	Taking the vaccine and having bad side effects far outweighs catching the virus and falling ill.
1	Taking the vaccine will safe people
0	Team pureblood here. It's amazing, if I had listened to the media I would have been sure I would die. Get rekt! Genuinely curious, how many of y'all who got the jab regret it now?
0	Tell that to the people who have died from the vaccine.
1	Tens of thousands of people die yearly from medical mistakes and drug reactions but people afraid of vaccines
1	Than you Pfizer for your vaccine. Please make a booster so that we're protected from these other variants.
1	Thank You for giving me a clear understanding. I, who was not very convinced with this vaccine idea, now have a change of mind. I'm getting vaccine tomorrow.
1	Thank god its working
1	Thank you ,Doctor. You were thorough and put my mind at ease regarding the vaccine. I wish I had a doctor like you who explained things with so much passion and compassion.
1	Thank you Darwin for weeding out these stupid selfish people who don't get vaccinated. They threaten all the rest of us.
1	Thank you Moderna!!
1	Thank you Pfizer for your tireless effort and determination to help the whole world.
1	Thank you baby Jesus for the mRNA vaccines
1	Thank you for destroying antivaxxers and covidiots with logic and scientifical evidences. To be honest, I feel so impressed on how scientists and experts can develop vaccine for COVID-19 faster than ever, thanks to medical science and technology that advanced farther.
1	Thank you for making this video to clear up the misconceptions people may have! Im from Texas, USA, and a lot of healthcare workers have been administered their first dose (yay)!!!
0	Thank you for sharing this info. I had Covid 4 months ago but at risk of losing my job on Jan.4th if I’m not fully vaccinated. I wish people would demand government to look at natural immunity & stop with vaccine mandates!!
1	Thank you for taking the time in many of your videos to explain to those who have trouble believing in the positive effects of the vaccine.
1	Thank you for the information I got my first shot yesterday (Pfizer) and I feel like total crap lol. I did have COVID and it was way worse than this.
1	Thank you for the vaccines
1	Thank you for this I'd done some basic reading after get my shot but this helped put everything into perspective
1	Thank you for your vaccine. I was able to visit my 98 y.o. grandma for the first time in 18 months.
1	Thank you so much for trying to keep us safe. I have had my bivalent booster. At 76 I do all I can to stay safe.
1	Thank you very much for vaccines, I’m 76 and have survived a number of illnesses including tuberculosis and polio .This year I have had my covid and influenza shots and doing just fine.
1	Thank you! I had a sister who died in the last polio epidemic in New Zealand in 1956, I was less than 1 year old. What my parents would have done for a Polio Vax is beyond words! Thank you again!
1	Thank you. Been trying to convince my early 20s daughter and her boyfriend of the importance of getting vaccinated. She agrees but can't be bothered. Hopefully this will be able to give her reasons I couldn't articulate other than "I love you and I don't want you to die."
1	Thank you... I feel encouraged to now get the vaccine... I appreciate the explanation ...
1	Thanks I really needed this because I haven’t been able to see my grand parents so I finally will
1	Thanks Jason. I appreciate what you guys do. I have been vaccinated twice. Biontech! I waa tested positive 3 days after the second vaccine. On my 11th day of the quarantine. Just felt tired and my fever climbed up to 37 at the first day and then it literally stopped. Havent felt anything since then.
1	Thanks a lot for this video. I got a shot two times with Biontech/Pfizer, but my husband got one shot of Johnon & Johnson and I was worried about if this was enough to keep him healthy. Now I'm much more confident.
0	Thanks for covering the risks of this covid injection. I did not take it so I'm not worried about myself. But I am concerned about others.
1	Thanks for creating this video! There is so much misinformation being spread about the disease and the vaccine, and you have made it very simple for people to understand. I hope this helps to dispel some of the fear people have of this vaccine.
0	Thanks for sharing. And many ridiculed those who did not get vaxxed. The trials/efficacy were skewed all along. Who do we trust? Hold the CDC accountable!!
1	Thanks so much, for the info on vaccines.
1	Thanks to both of you for the great information. Where can I find more information about getting vaccinated in my state? Az
1	Thanks to continue the best awareness of people to vaccination its very important for effect the diseases.
1	Thanks to vaccine million Life was safe
0	Thanks, this only confirms that C-19 vaccines can be dangerous.
0	That feel when I’m never getting the corony vaccine and nothing will ever make me
1	That newfound mRNA way to create a vaccine, salute for the scientist! And thanks vox for explaining it so well so easy to understand
1	That second dose really surprised me I was ready for the worst pain and side effects but it was not as bad as the first for me, except for a sore arm and fatigue that went away with an extra nap the second day I was quite happy.
1	That shot was so quick and smooth
1	That woman crying over kids being vaccinated was the most ridiculous thing. Children having their rights taken away? Like they already had rights in that area to begin with! Parents are legally able to make all medical decisions for children. So if a kid wants a vaccine but their parent won’t do it, they’re shit out of luck. I hope she never becomes a nurse. She’s clearly not learned anything.
0	That's a no from me dawg.
1	That's exactly why I took J&J, saved myself a trip and avoided another jab.
1	That’s not what my girlfriend’s cousin’s friend’s father’s great uncle’s chiropractor’s buddy told me….
0	The 'Covid-19 vaccine' was an experimental mRNA gene therapy, the trial was completed in March 2023, it is neither safe nor effective, infact it's a very real danger to health.
0	The 'vaccine' has weakened people's immune systems, that's why they're sick.
0	The COVID vaccine killed 17 million people.
1	The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in 141 countries averted 2.4 million excess deaths by August 2021 and would have saved another 670,000 more lives had vaccines been distributed equitably, estimates a working paper from University of Southern California (USC) and Brown University researchers.
1	The Covid vaccinations, masks and washing your hands are great tools to fight this virus. Also helps mitigate flu transmission from person to person.
0	The Covid vaccine is basically that medicine that does more damage than it fixes
0	The Covid vaccines are not safe & are a nightmare we can't wake up from
1	The Covid-19 Vaccine safe life thanks god it came out
0	The Pfizer vaccine has never been approved for use in humans, and was granted only emergency authorization. Pfizer would only agree if they could not be sued. The safety trials are still ongoing, they are lying by omission.
1	The Vaccine Might Make You Drowsy For A Day But Save Your Life.
0	The Vaxx is poison it's a death jab
1	The anti vaxxers are stuck In a dangerous cult. It's a hard one who will I listen to a medical doctor with years of experience or someone with no medical training. Yeah sure a small number of people can have adverse reactions it's sad but this is a tiny percentage. Vaccines have saved so many lifes.
1	The anti vaxxers have done a splendid job of poisoning gullible people’s minds concerning any vaccines.
1	The anti-vaccine movement needs to let their insurance company know. When they catch COVID and get hospitalized, they will pay their own bill!
1	The backlash against vaccinations, one of the best tools humanity has developed to increase lifespans, is just an indicator of how strong the anti-intellectual movement has become because of social media.
0	The best decision I have ever made in my life was to not get the poison jabbed into me.
0	The best thing about resisting is not having to worry about SADS
1	The biggest Vaccine side effect is that you might just live long enough to experience your first breakup
1	The billions of doses confirmed the safety pretty quickly. Not because they were greenlit to be administered but because when you apply a treatment to billions of people, all of them are in different states. With all people in different states, if something could go wrong it would go wrong immediately in a visible portion of people. Other than one extremely rare problem early on with Moderna in specific groups of people, this was not observed and the safety was confirmed rather quickly. When the sample size is in the billions, statistics get weird.
0	The conspiracy is that the government gave Pfizer billions of dollars to make vaccines that don’t work, and are continuing to pretend that they do work in order to save face.
0	The country has lost its damn mind. Do not get vaccinated with an experimental vaccine while you're pregnant. Just because a doc says it's OK doesn't mean it is. Look at all the thalidomide babies! Good lord.
0	The covid 19 vaccines are killing and maming people this is a fact! How about telling people they may expect death or disability after their vaccine
0	The day I trust CNN for news is the same day I'll trust Pfizer toxins injected in my blood. Controlled media puppets.
1	The delta variant has a 1,260 times more transmissable rate than the original covid 19 virus. Therefore there is more likelihood of more infections. Vaccination with 2 doses has shown to be an effective barrier against a severe case of covid.
1	The fact is that COVID-19 vaccination causes a more predictable immune response than an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.
0	The fact it became available within a year is terrifying. Probably going to do more harm than good.
0	The fact that Big Tech and Gov and Pharma along with Tik Tok nurses have combined forces to shame the world into taking this cocktail is enough reason to run from it
0	The fact that can use the logic of “this is a extremely rare side effect” and still force the vaccine but cant use the same logic of its extremely rare for me to die of covid regardless if I’m vaccinated is really aggravating
0	The fact that the producers aren't liable for any damages including injury and death says it all to me. How tf is it so hard to grasp?
0	The fact that they’re even considering giving this out to children who are not even affected is incredibly disturbing. These people are so crooked.
0	The fact that those vaccine makers have legal immunity tells you everything you need to know about those toxic warp speed concoctions.
1	The fastest way out of this pandemic is through mass vaccination. This INCLUDES children. We can't vaccinate children without safety data - & to do that we need children in trials. If you have an adolescent interested - here's info about Moderna's trial.
0	The figures are reported if you die from covid but censored if you die from the vaccine. Hmmm.
0	The four types of vaccine are: 1.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one. 2.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one. 3.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one. 4.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one.
0	The government intervened in the promotion of vaccines, which made the vaccine lose a certain degree of credibility
1	The infection rate is 30k ish a day. Our vaccination is 20x better. Eat that COVID!
0	The ingredients wouldn't help a fly get better it's all nasty stuff why would anyone think those ingredients would keep you immunized it's ridiculous it's like the emperor's new clothes
0	The junk should have been completely pulled off the market by now.
0	The mRNA Pfizer vaccine made me pretty sick for a full week. I would not get it again. My first vaccine was J&J. I slept and felt a little sick for 2 days from the J&J….my booster was Pfizer.
1	The messed up thing was during this time frame alot of people like myself were so overwhelmed at work that we had no time to do anything but work and sleep. We didn't even get lunch breaks. Thankfully alot of the craziness in retail had slowed down and I have since been able to get vaccinated
0	The money from the Vaccine has sure saved their family, it just dosen't prevent infection, or really do anything else.
0	The more I learn, the more I am glad I didn’t get the jab
0	The more concentrated the product is in your blood the higher the death rate, the “sticky ends” of component in shot forms fibrous chains causing strokes, sudden death. The product released on market was not what Pharma showed FDA. Product to market was not produced or purified correctly. They knew that they were lying and now people are still dying. Pay close attention to the courts!
1	The more people who are vaccinated, the more lives will be saved and the less the virus is in circulating the lower the chance of variants developing. It is right and sensible to take up the offer.
0	The more u try to force something on anyone the more they become suspicious of it. And the more suspicious they get, the more they reject it.
1	The most common side effect of the COVID vaccine is not dying of COVID
1	The myocarditis associated with the Covid 19 vaccine is mild and recoverable. You know what causes deadly myocarditis? The SARS Co-V2 virus itself. Thanks, I’ll take the vaccine. My cardiologist highly recommended it, and he’s the best in my state.
0	The natural healing force within each of us is the greatest force in getting well
1	The new classical vaccines ( without mRNA and graphen) function perfectly as boosters so e.g. Novavax, without devastating side effects.
1	The news about the vaccines was incredibly good, and maybe it's that I'm a pessimist, but the news seems almost too good. Hoping for the best.
0	The next morning, Ching’s pharmacy was bombarded with calls from people anxious to be vaccinated. He had no shots left.
0	The only thing i need to know is that i,m never taking it.......
0	The people that remained unvaccinated are very happy thank you very much I'm getting on with my life listening to the band the eyes of isabel and partying
1	The problem nowadays(maybe always was like that idk) is that everyone is having an opinion but barely anyone did real research. Thanks for this video
0	The problem with this vaccine is that it sounds really shady and I don't like stuff that is shady.
0	The real virus is in those vaccines
1	The research studies says that it boosts our body's protection, also called immunity, against catching the virus that causes COVID-19.
0	The right to control what enters your body is absolutely and unquestionably a basic human right.
0	The same people who have gaslighted and lied to us all these years are now pushing this rushed vaccine HARD. I’ll take my chances with the 99% survival rate of covid
0	The same people willing to take the Vaccine are the same people that will only buy organic foods because they don't trust the foods that agencies like the FDA and USDA or basically the government says are perfectly safe to eat with the GMO's ,artificial fillers, antibiotics , etc but now believe anything the government tells them?
1	The same reason you are vaccinated against a host of viruses that have low incidence rates. Because the potential consequences of getting the virus (spreading it to others, getting seriously sick, death, long-term issues) is much higher than any potential side effect from the vaccine. The same reason there was a mandate for something like smallpox. Vaccines are not new, Vaccine mandates are not new, vaccine hesitancy is not new. You ideas are not unique or special or even relevant. You should read about typhoid mary and then come back with a new perspective. Your personal freedoms and liberty only last until you potentially violate another's. In the case of public health its much more nuanced but the principal stands.
0	The scariest thing about all of this is how naive and ignorant people are, they buy anything the media throws at them.
0	The scary part is that now, if you’re up to date. There’s absolutely nothing you can do to remove it from your body. Expect incoming reports to keep you up at night.
0	The shot would make me sicker than what COVID could do.
0	The side effects are not rare, they are simply suppressed
0	The so-called mRNA vaccines have ZERO efficacy! They do not prevent infection or transmission of #WuhanFlu. They are PROVEN to injure a larger percentage of those who receive them than any other REAL Vaccine by leaps and bounds. They are responsible for causing blood clots, myocarditis, and death! YOU ARE A GODDAMN FOOL IF YOU GET IT! AND YOU ARE EVIL IF YOU LET YOUR CHILD GET IT!
0	The truth is slowly trickling out
0	The unscientific, unethical, unconstitutional COVID-19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers was predicated on lies which I exposed on the House floor. The House will vote to end this mandate today.
0	The unvaccinated are doing great
0	The unvacinated will survive
0	The vaccine brain damage has already got these people.
1	The vaccine brings a sense of optimism and unity in our global community.
1	The vaccine has a low probability of side effects
1	The vaccine is a crucial tool in controlling the spread of COVID-19
1	The vaccine is a testament to human innovation and resilience.
1	The vaccine is effective against the covid19
1	The vaccine is incredibly safe. You are looking at the numbers decontextualized from total doses administered globally. Way way way safer than COVID.
0	The vaccine is not safe, and is not approved. They are pushing for such quick fda approval because they want to silence this argument. Only reason.
1	The vaccine is safe... study the ingredients, do research on the ingredients
1	The vaccine is working well
1	The vaccine offers a path towards ending the pandemic
0	The vaccine sounds more scary than the virus
0	The vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.
1	The vaccine will help to protect child from getting sick from COVID-19
1	The vaccines are safer versions of covid so that our immune systems can respond.
0	The vaccines have already killed 17 million people. Is the WHO hinting that some of these diseases may return when they release disease X? They are not to be trusted, don't fall for their deceit to take their vaccines.
1	The vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in prvailing illness from COVID-19 among children
0	The virus is fake. The hospitals are empty. The doctors' surgeries are empty. The test centres are empty. The scamdemic is a fraud. Resist fascism!
0	The way they are trying (and failing) to explain how the vaccines are still beneficial is so embarrassing...
1	The woman at the beginning saying because of her personal experience she is anti vaccines is like a person getting into a car accident and then being anti-cars.
1	The worst part is the anti-vaxxers.
1	The worst thing that happened to me when I got vaccinated was a fever and swollen lymph nodes. Why am I still very pro Vax? Because it's just telling me my body is making antibodies against covid, and all it caused was minor inconvenience. I'd rather be safe than sorry
0	The 💉 is experimental. Good luck sheep
0	There are a lot of innocent persons who trusted their governments and medical personnels and took the jab. Please pray for them.
1	There are complications with or without the vaccine-I have been vaccinated and had such a light case when I did get it 2 yrs after it started - I was well in 2 days. So far I’ve had no bad effects. I am thankful for the vaccine - but that’s my choice and my opinion. I’m 66 and have had EVERY vaccine available throughout my life - I’m still here and that means they are doing the job intended. I am healthy & thankful.
0	There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I've never heard so much nonsense talked about vaccines.
0	There is evidence that it has saved 10s of thousands of lives??? I dont think so!!
1	There is extremely little risk to the vaccine. We know this and it's been reported on accurately. There is some unidentifiable greater risk to getting COVID based solely on the existence of long COVID, even if it's less common than you think. The risk/reward is very easy.
1	There is no excuse for not getting vaccinated.
0	There is no reason to take it anymore stop pushing unproven crap so some people can make a buck
0	There is no way I'm getting a vaccine for a virus that I can easily live through.
0	There is no way anyone would fall for this garbage!
0	There should be a complete stop to these injectables with a full investigation and people held accountable with jail time. Or the gallows.
0	There was a reason why vaccine manufacturers disclaimed that they bear no liability to serious side effects from their vaccines. We are now promptly seeing this reason.
0	There's nothing wrong with not wanting to have an injection, we don't need, and don't know is safe.
1	There’s a saying that goes something like this “Winning an argument against a smart person is hard. Winning an argument against an ignorant person is impossible.”
0	There’s aborted babies in this new vaccine...
0	There’s no way after the last experience they ever get me again.
0	These are not vaccines in a traditional sense. They are playing with your genes.
1	These parents should be forced to home school their children. These parents have No right to endanger the infant and children population of an entire state. This isn't a personal freedom issue it's a public safety issue!!
0	These words these diagrams/drawings...trial stages....two shots...what?! Naah, can't trust y'all*
0	They are forcing me to take that poison!!
0	They are not telling us the truth and people are just lining up for this....
0	They are pushing this to hard.... And when you see doctor and health care workers not getting it..... This entire thing has me thinking something not right
0	They are safe for no one
0	They can choke on those shots
0	They do this to try and scare the unvaccinated. Shame!
1	They do work, as explain in the video. It also helps permanently, because your body can recognize the virus as a threat
0	They don't talk about the side effect rates and severity of the vaccines. From what I hear from the military, is the mRNA have have cause a lot of other health issues.
0	They injected people with a man made code that hijacks your cells to produce a non-human toxic spike protein. They called it a "vaccine".
1	They know the vaccine is safe already. They had to trash its reputation in order to stop demand for something they simply do not have due to their useless preparations.
1	They need to focus on vaccinate everyone above 55 like ASAP. Even in third world countries bc that thing keeps goin around around and who knows wth is gonna turn into. And old ppl are the most at risk, once theyre vaccinated they can give it to younger ppl and get that virus under control.
0	They need to shut up and know the covid vaccine is unhealthy and had not been tested that well.
1	They said everybody who got the covid vax would die? What happened? I don't regret getting it five times. I still haven't gotten covid. Maybe I'm just lucky.
0	They said there were NO side effects, now they say there were limited side effects, what are they gonna say in the future? Lies are lies, trust is key and it was lost, period!
1	They save way more lives than they take. Why rely on natural immunity when your natural immunity may not be enough? Vaccines don't replace your immune system, they supplement it.
0	They set themselves free if it kills you by having you sign you "understand the benefits AND risks" meaning you understand it can kill you. NTY I'm not doing it.
1	They should be vaccinated to be safe from COVID
0	They told you it was “safe and effective” but they didn’t tell you for what. It will safely and effectively diminish your immune system, give you heart inflammation, blood clots just to name a few. Glad I held my ground and said nope, not getting it!
0	They were so right..:: the rest of us were led like sheep. I regret ever having put that crap in my body.
0	They're missing the point - it's not about whether or not the vaccine works; it's your right to deny it if you wish, because it's your body.
0	They’re going to blame the vaccine side effects on other “covid variants” meanwhile everyone will be dying off by their own stupidity for taking the vaccine. Don’t be fooled.
0	This demon can’t even keep viruses out of windows, now he wants to vaccinate the whole world. oh my god, somebody wake up!!!
1	This feels like watching someone getting injured in a car crash because they refused to wear seatbelts claiming that they "dont work" Ironic and borderline hilarious
0	This is 80% fact 20% plain wrong, and also pushes the plain unknown with total confidence, I recomend you look at the numbers in the uk of deaths from covid after vaccination, from start feb, to aug 8th 2021 the deaths of people vaccinated outnumber those not!!!! DONT BELIEVE ME LOOK YOURSELF,
1	This is a sad story. It is reported very well. And provokes mixed feelings. Sympathy, of course, for those dead and dying from Covid. And the throwing up of hands in exasperation since unscientific quackery keeps folks from protecting their lives.
1	This is by far the best news since the vaccine came out imo. Even if the vaccine just partially stops the spread, it's still great news
1	This is good news regarding the Covid vaccine for kids. Note myocarditis is more prominent in unvaccinated kids who get Covid.
1	This is good news! I can see this is the beginning of the end of this pandemic. Hopefully, this virus will be completely eradicated by next year including the new variant.
1	This is great news! Looking forward to having 100% of my family members vaccinated and having a great summer.
1	This is great news... Just stick to the science, rigorous testing, and 3rd party retesting. By all means remove any red tape, but don't remove even a single safety protocol.
1	This is incredibly reassuring. My sister and her boyfriend both just got J&J and I was a bit concerned for them, that they wouldn't be as protected as me or other people who got Pfizer or moderna.
0	This is like someone jumping into a giant fire pit and then screaming to others, “come on in, the fire is nice!“
1	This is objectively very fucking good.
1	This is probably THE best video debunking anti-vax claims. While the first one isn't quite well after Pfizer got approved last month, it still holds pretty strong so thanks!
1	This is smart and I just got my vaccine today
0	This is the begining of their NEW WORLD ORDER, reset the people's genetic material through the vaccine.
1	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus... omg guys i got the vaccine now im magnetic🖤
1	This is too much science for anti-vaxers.
0	This is truly horrifying. Your covid vaccine was never meant to be safe, or effective!
1	This is what we need to play in schools. Educate the safety of vaccines to kids.
0	This is why it is better by far to go through proper extended testing instead of rushing in to mass vaccination.
1	This made me feel so much better, honestly the vaccine is the way to go. If you want this to end, take the vaccine ladies and gentlemen!
0	This seems kinda dumb. If the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting covid, why would it be routine? Shouldn't it just fall in with the flu vaccine, and you can get it if you want to yearly at Walgreens?
1	This should be required viewing for every person who doesn't want to take it because they think the vaccine (for Covid19) is a hoax
0	This study did convince me of one thing, that not getting the jab was one of the best decisions in my life. The more they push, the more convicted I am.
1	This vaccination is essential for global public health, as it helps control the spread of the virus across borders and reduces the likelihood of new variants emerging.
1	This vaccine brings us one step closer to returning to normal
0	This vaccine is affecting my health in various ways I never felt fever in my life but after this vaccine.
0	This vaccine is neither safe nor effective. Obviously. The deaths have risen after the vaccine came out. Most of the sick and dying are vaccinated right now. Gaslighting is exactly what the government & media has done to us all for the past few years. The greatest harm to us all- no trust anymore in the media or government. The damage to this country by corrupt politicians and government officials should create a real reaction from us all to remain united & demand justice. Be smart and follow science, the real science not the bought & paid for corrupt science.
1	This video is great. I wish though that the vaccine strategy takes into account the debilitating effects of long COVID, people like me who had almost no initial symptoms and now with a potential life sentence. Vaccine is better than no vaccine, but simply "de-fang" is not enough when an estimated 1/3 of infected will get long COVID.
1	This video is longer than the lifespan of a antivax kid
1	Thnx to medicine and science we are having a better and long life
0	Those who take the vaccine will face problems in the future and rue the day they did not have the courage to say NO.
0	Thumbs DOWN.......DONT TAKE IT...
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!
1	To all the young adults with anxiety: it is okay if you need moral support for your vaccine appointment. My mom came with me for my first dose, and since she was already vaccinated, they even let her stay with me through the whole process. But even just having a trusted friend or family member in the car with you can be a huge help.
1	To be a champion is to be in good health. Being healthy means being vaccinated.
1	To the point and very informative. I am sharing with those who haven't vaccinated. Thank you
0	Today I stopped my monthly donation to Unicef. I don't want to support your vaccination program for Covid-19!
1	Today is my birthday and I couldn’t have asked for a better gift then to break all these vaccine records, awesome news!
0	Today's vaccine propaganda message
0	Too short a time for development and testing
1	Took mine no side effects at all just arm was a little sore
1	Took my first dose today in Illinois, feeling good!
1	Took my first part of the vaccine, didn't feel a thing...
0	Trials? Are you kidding? Real trials go on for years. I understand we can't do that right now. But who knows what it's going to show long-term
1	Trump lies even when the truth will do. The tens of thousands of lies he has told that his adoring followers believe (a fair share of those lies being about COVID-19) has so polluted the Republican Party that it has morphed into America's Fifth Column. The reluctance by his followers to get vaccinated is based on lies told by him and other Republican politicians, and not only puts all of us at risk, but all of the world's population at risk. Moreover, there has been evidence that mammalian animal species such as cats (big and small), dogs and minks can be infected with COVID-19, aka SARS-CoV-2. While these animals currently do not seem to become seriously ill or even to die the possibility exists that they could become reservoirs or vectors of the virus that they could then pass on, possibly as a lethal variant, back to humans. Mississippi, wake up! America, wake up! Get vaccinated!
1	Trust the science!!
0	Trusting your doctor blindly is really a huge part of the problem. I think it’s best to take responsibility and also research very well for yourself! Many doctors are just excellent parrots of what they’re told. It doesn’t mean they’re told the truth by pharmaceutical sales reps, nor does being a GP, for example, mean you’re automatically a skilled critical thinker.
1	UNICEF you are doing and distributing vaccines booster COVID-19 make for more confident and safe for people.Thank you so much.
0	Ummm, I'll pass on that. I'll wait until these politicians and celebrities shows how effective it is. It seems like the side effects is worst than Covid-19 itself
0	Unvaccinated and proud, and you need to take a good look in the mirror if you pressured anyone into getting that garbage.
1	Unvaccinated kids are just speedrunning life
1	Unvaccinated people over 65 in the US had a 52x higher rate of hospitalization from Covid in December than people in the same age group who were up-to-date with their vaccination. Get vaccinated and boosted!
0	Unvaccinated will be fine
0	Unvaccinated. Never took part in this pantomime as history has taught me not too. Still alive and well 👌🏼 turning off my tv has been the best vaccine money can buy, 100% safe and effective!
0	Unvaxxed, no regret, still alive, never got covid.... Fit and perfectly healthy.... My relative got cancer not long after the jab
0	Useless vaccine , Nothing more than business
0	VAERS and excess deaths point to this particular Vax not being what it should be. It doesn't treat, prevent, or cure the illness. It doesn't prevent transmission either. So why should I take it?
1	Vacations are wonderful.
1	Vaccinate the working population first and the teachers get the kids back to school and the people back to work it makes more sense before we all die from starvation
1	Vaccinated and not infected yet. Fingers crossed!
1	Vaccination is a human right .
1	Vaccination is great way to build our immunity. It's a only one way to fight against corona virus. Make sure to protect our society
1	Vaccinations work. Who knew?
0	Vaccine and illuminate sign this vaccine is number 666 sign that if you have no this vaccine 666 you can't buy a sell Satan program. Don't agree this .
0	Vaccine are poison!
1	Vaccine hesitancy is very common sadly but I think helping explain how it works helps. I helped ease my mom's worries by explaining it and showing her videos and she got her second one recently!
0	Vaccine is not an appropriate word. The word is experimental. Please do your research before deciding to have an EXPERIMENTAL AGENT injected into your body. Stay safe.
0	Vaccine is to control the world population not stop covid had nothing to do with covid
0	Vaccine not reliable
0	Vaccine should be first tested on others, and then I shall take
0	Vaccine will not help
1	Vaccine works. Reduces symptoms. I got mine. Wife didn’t. Both of us got covid last month. Mine was like a 3 day cold. Hers was like a horrible flu and she was ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE for an entire week. She will get her shot next year. Case closed.
0	Vaccine? No thx my body works fine.
0	Vaccines again? Absolutely not! All my friends at backside book are poisoned with vaccines, but not me. I will not die or get blood clots!
1	Vaccines and medications aren’t destroying humanity, no — it’s the anti-vaxxer community’s complete ignorance and misinformation that’s destroying humanity from being able to save itself.
1	Vaccines are especially important for people at increased risk, such as people with chronic lung diseases and those who are immunocompromised. The best way to protect yourself and vulnerable family members from severe COVID-19 is to get vaccinated.
1	Vaccines are our best tool in the fight against COVID-19. If you haven’t yet, please get vaccinated and get boosted.
1	Vaccines are really good for you.
1	Vaccines are such a human achievement. The more i learn about them the more im impressed
1	Vaccines are wonderful. However, I will wait a bit before getting this one. Many different vaccines for COVID-19 and Astra Zeneca one has been halted.
1	Vaccines can have a certain effect
1	Vaccines can help to improve your immunity
1	Vaccines can't fight COVID-19 when people are unwilling to take them.
1	Vaccines definitely work but I’d like to see one of these with obesity too.
1	Vaccines do cause severe side-effects, the thing is, THAT IS VERY VERY RARE, so it is worth taking the risk.
0	Vaccines do not cause autism. Sure. I have autistic daughter. When she was 8 month she was vaccinated (6in1). Next day she got fever, she got normal after 3-4 days. But after 2 weeks she stopped to laugh, look in the eyes and play with her toys. She became quiet, kind of thinking inside. Now she's 10 yo. She can't talk and shows typical autism symptoms. I've done her hair analysis and it clearly showed that after vaccination the level of aluminium in her body raised multiple times above secure levels. Continue to lie.
1	Vaccines do not cause autism. This whole narrative is so totally batshit crazy that I can’t even imagine who thinks this should be publicised.
0	Vaccines have harmful ingredients such as baby cells, mercury, and so on. It’s not meant to reside in a humans body
0	Vaccines have never been Double Blind Placebo tested. WHY? The only pharmaceutical used on mass where this is the case. WHY?
1	Vaccines help boost immunity
1	Vaccines protect against covid
1	Vaccines r a no brainer, protect yourself and others.
1	Vaccines save lives! Please don't hesitate to be a part of this universal fight against #COVID19
1	Vaccines save lives.
1	Vaccines work…and I am absolutely pro-vaccine
0	Vacination is NOT the best way.... Heathy diet Vitamin C, D3 and Zinc is the way out..... WHO you said one can still be infected with the virus even if you get the jab. So why should people take d jab..the only reason there is push for d vaccines is selfish interest of few men who want to control the world
0	Vacination is a genocide.
1	Very rare 1:100,000 to 1:600,000 risk of clots with vaccine
1	Very well said as the proper treatment will save the lives of millions of people.
0	Very, very proud and relieved to be un-vaxed
0	Vitamin D. Zinc. Vitamin C and others are the way for me.
0	WAKE UP!! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR HEALTH!!! BEING SICK IS A BUSINESS $$$$
1	WELL THANK GOD FOR THIS VACCINE
0	WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS? WHY IS IT NOT FDA APPROVED? I NEED THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED BEFORE I GET AN EXPERIMENTAL 'VACCINE'.
0	WORD OF THE LORD: DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE. PEOPLE WILL LITERALLY BECOME ZOMBIES WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS!!! Pray and confirm before you mock and scoff!
1	WOW now this had truly been a blessing, thank you and have a blessed day
0	WTF? This is sick how they want to try to manipulate you to get the shot
1	Was finally able to get my first dose Wednesday, feeling good no side effects
1	Was there a major drop in deaths when the vaccines got rolled out? 97% is pretty damn effective.
1	Was vaccinated last month and the relief I had knowing I could safely hug my family cannot be put into words. I would take that one sucky post vaccine day over another year of COVID in a heartbeat. Get vaccinated!!
1	Watching this after getting my first dose of Moderna Vaccine!
1	Watching this with the second shot of vaccine in my arm. Thank you!!!!
1	We are all in this together you good little citizens!
1	We are finally having some respite from the year that 2020 have been. Can't wait until we can freely go outside and enjoy without feeling guilty about it.
0	We are good here in Africa, don't bring your immune destroyer here. What happened to the American senator that took the vaccine yet test positive to covid19 ?
0	We are just guinea pigs. This is what you get when you put murdered baby material into people's arms.
0	We as the people need to fight back by not taking it n if they try to force it that means war time
1	We can do it! I'm literally sitting in the waiting area after getting my first shot right now!
1	We do all recommended vaccines, including flu and COVID. My 6 month old got hers last week!
0	We have all had some vaccines throughout our lives yet none of them left us bedridden for two days with uncontrollable chills and 102 fever that is not normal I am sorry
1	We have the tools we need to protect ourselves from severe COVID. Please get your free COVID-19 vaccine and booster. It could save your life or someone you love.
1	We must get the children vaccinated so we can get back to normal
1	We need this video translated to other languages. There are people who fear the vaccine because they don't know what it is and how it works.
0	We need to STOP calling these things "side-effects" !!!!! They ARE EFFECTS !!!!!!!
1	We need to educate people about vaccination. Even my parents refused to be vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson because of its "efficacy rate"
1	We need to get children vaccinated to get schools back on track
1	We weren't asked to go to war and sacrifice our lives. We were asked to protect ourselves, protect the vulnerable and get a needle. Pretty easy decision for me. Triple vaxxed and proud to be part of a loving, caring society.
1	We will have gain a sense of personal protection and peace of mind, knowing that we are less likely to experience severe illness if exposed to the virus.
0	We're going to have a great battle of conflicting statisticians. You've heard the old saying: there are liars, there are damned liars, and then there are statisticians.
0	We're witness to the greatest crime against humanity ever seen.
0	Well I WONT BE GETTING ANY BLOODY Needle, there is no way this is ready for release , it's still mutating .
1	Well I didn't get covid, so in that way I'm happy. Also I didn't succumb to misinformation and regressive science denialism, so I'm proud to get the vaccine in that way as well.
0	Well I like the fact that my immune system already had an adaptive response to Covid-19. How cool is that.
1	Well done for taking part in a trial. It’s thanks to people like you the vaccines were ready for all of us.
1	Well it time to meet God since you don't have the vaccine
0	Well well well…. What do they have to say now since people have died of covid while fully vaccinated?
1	Well you've got more chance of catching Covid and developing severe blood clots from that than you do from any vaccine. FACT.
1	Well, Im 53, received all of the vacs and boosters,never had covid nor did I develop autism or heart problems. So yeah, Im happy about it.
1	Well, after receiving the 2nd shot I had a sort of mild fever and headache. The experience was worse than that of the 1st shot. I couldn't sleep. Also had injection site pain which isn't a big deal cuz it's a very common and natural side effect. However, I am doing well now and I am fine.
1	What I truly don’t understand is that if you don’t believe the medical profession regarding their opinion on Covid and the vaccine then why bother going to medical professionals to get better? I feel for the health care workers. My heart goes out to them.
1	What a convenient timing, I’m getting my vaccine today, this helped me feel a lot more excited Update: just got my first shot and I’m feeling great! Thank you Ted for sharing this important message and I wish everyone a great day, except for the anti vax people commenting here. Stay safe!
0	What about all the people that died shortly after taking the jab? Nobody it’s tracking that. Doctors are silent. There is a huge problem people!
0	What about all the people who've died, or who have been injured after getting the coronavirus vaccine?
0	What about sudden deaths after the jabs Mr Faucci.
0	What about the microchips?
0	What about the risk of vaccine injury for this experimental drug. The real numbers of adverse reactions are being covered up.
0	What could possibly go wrong? Never made a coronavirus vaccine before, never used mRNA before, but we're gonna do it now, as fast as possible? Yikes.
0	What happened to the theory of Survival of the Fittest?! I think we should let nature take its course, and the pharmaceutical firms to stop making money!!!!
0	What if the Covid vaccine really is giving us a third strand of DNA?
0	What people justice to choose for themselves what goes in their bodies ,alyo need to leave people alone
0	What really is important are parents that are wise enough not to subject their children to such "treatments"
1	What's frustrating is if I sent this video to the anti covid vaxxers I know they would disregard it claiming is brain washing or you are just plain wrong, or you are lying for some reason. I ask them what the difference is when they send me their informational videos? They claim their information is right, I ask how they know that. And that is usually when they stop replying to me or they send me another link.
0	What’s wrong with a natural immune system?
0	When are people going to stand up against this tyranny?? This is complete madness
1	When it hit my work it took out a good third of the residents within a month. Now everyone gets every shot as soon as it’s available. We recently had an outbreak and all anyone got was a cold.
1	When someone tells me they aren’t getting the vaccine because they aren’t “afraid of Covid”, I ask if they are afraid of needles and suggest they could go to therapy to get over their fear of needles. Turn the narrative around to make them be the fearful ones.
0	When the most evil people on the planet are telling you to be a good neighbor and get a "safe" vaccine, run like a kid who's just been offered a lollipop from a strange man in a van!
0	When they can get together to vaccinate the entire world's population, but can't arrange to feed the starving, it's proof that this is not about health or 'saving lives'.
0	When trial research results are sealed from the public for 70 years; that’s all I need to know on “patient safety.”
0	When you eat something it is mandatory to have the ingredients on the label when you get a vaccine questioning what the ingrdience is taboo because if you understood you would never agree to injecting poison into your body
0	Where is the vaccine control study?
1	While I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines.
1	While no vaccine is 100% effective, vaccination has been shown to provide a degree of protection against various COVID-19 variants, reducing the severity of illness and preventing hospitalization.
1	Who else DIDN’T suffer severe side effects from getting the COVID vaccine?
0	Who else is packing up for this zombie apocalypse
0	Who's here after the vaccines have been proven to be more dangerous than helpful?
1	Whoa whoa whoa, have we checked with the folks who did their own research?
1	Why I don't vaccinate my- Never mind. He dead.
1	Why are people anti-vaxxers? I don’t get it
0	Why are people taking a experimental vaccine, for a virus with a 99% survival rate?
1	Why are vaccines important? In 2020, vaccines prevent more than 1.2m deaths globally. An additional 2 million child deaths could be prevented each year through immunization with currently available vaccines. Stay away from #misinformation and #GetVaccinated #StaySafe
0	Why didnt the government let us use other options that did work?
1	Why do people keep saying the COVID vaccines are untested? They were tested and followed extremely closely throughout the entire global community with public results.
0	Why do we even need a vaccine for a virus with a 99.98% recovery rate?
0	Why do you have to explain this over and over is it even worth it? Here in Zimbabwe we are using natural remedies and have proven effective so far so good
1	Why do you think any of this is caused by vaccination? And not COVID itself?
0	Why don't they aspirate the injection, there is always a little risk it can get into the bloodstream.
0	Why don't you properly test these drugs first ffs?!
0	Why get a vaccine when it is proven that you can get the virus again even after the vaccine. I would rather get the virus again and not get a dirty old vaccine.
0	Why not speak about the long term affects of all the covid vaccines? Because nobody knows for sure
0	Why should big pharma make all the money?
0	Why should we get vaccinated and boosted? So we can still catch Covid AND take a risk of experimental drugs with zero long term studies performed? No thanks.
0	Why should you vaccinate something that already works well? If your car is doing well, you don't take it to the garage, do you?
0	Why the fuck are people still calling these poison shots vaccines
0	Why would I put something in my body when I don’t even know what’s in it?
0	Why would a healthy fit person need to take it of whatever age when it has been created in less than 8 months not knowing long term side effects.
0	Why would you need a vaccine when you have a 99.9% chance of surviving covid in the first place
0	Why would young healthy people get a vaccination for a virus with a 98% survival rate?
1	Wife and I received our pfizer today, and nothing but a sore arm.
0	Will I take this vaccine, let me think for a minute, NOOOOOOOO
0	Wish I never got it....I now have cancer at 37
1	With most conspiracy theorists, they feel they know things others don't and it makes them special.
0	Without a doubt, if it happened to him it can happen to me. I am sure he never thought he'd have adverse side effects before getting vaxed, but he did. Until we learn more about WHY some get adverse effects while others don't, I will remain unvaxed
0	Won't be going anywhere near this poison!!
1	Woohoo! Just got home from getting my second shot (Pfizer)
0	Worried about side effects in the future
1	Would have loved it more if it had dedicated more explaining about the mRNA part, cause that’s the part antivaxxers use to spread fear.
0	Wow we only have to take poison once a year instead of every three months. How kind of our reptile overlords
0	Wow! I never thought I'd see the day when a vaccine would be banned. More of this needs to happen
0	Wow, I wonder why, so many cases of died suddenly happened.
0	Wow, have you read anything not spoon fed to you. This vaccine was a dangerous cash grab and not worth the risk
1	Wow, mind blowing. I was vaccinated and boosted. I got covid this week. I’ve been pretty sick the last few days BUT if I weren’t vaccinated I would be in much worse shape. I have asthma and my breathing is FINE. I have had chills, headache, fatigue, runny nose, cough and sore throat. It’s not easy but I don’t think I’d be recovering at home if I didn’t get vaccinated. I’d be in a hospital
0	Y'all stupid if u think I'm a take a vaccine
1	YAY SCIENCE!
1	YES literally couldn't get signed up fast enough once it opened up to me. I did it to protect myself, others, and the baby that was growing inside me at that time
1	YES. I do not understand peoples fear of vaccines. We have literal proof that they work.
0	YOU CANNOT FORCE ANYONE TO GET THE COVID VACCINE ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO DO THIS WILL BE SUED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW AND THAT MEANS EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY!
0	YOU'RE LYING THE VAX IS KILLING HEALTHY PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW IT.
0	Ya know anybody who gets this thing is just straight up brainwashed
1	Yay! I get the J&J Tuesday! Can’t wait!!!
0	Yea right, no one knows the effects of this new vaccine product, long term especially. The world is the project.
1	Yeaaaa had my vaccine today, halfway to freedom I hope, side effects with everything, its a chance you take.
0	Yeah it’s dangerous for us to think outside public opinion... that means we’re probably doing something right
1	Yeah no shit they're safe. The problem is that this news pretty much will fall on deaf ears. The people who need to hear this are the ones who AREN'T going to hear it....
1	Yeah no shit. And those of us who work in Healthcare are beyond frustrated that we have to deal with these morons who refuse to get vaccinated and are now taking up a large chunk of our hospital beds and resources. My hospital for the past few weeks has had about an 8 hour ER wait because we are getting so many COVID patients coming in with shortness of breath. Surprise surprise when we find out they aren't vaccinated. Fuck all these idiots.
0	Yeah passing on all of it.
1	Yeah, it's really difficult to choose between trusting a doctor with several years of studies and a Karen that googles things and spreads misinformation on Facebook
0	Yeah, right! No thanks!
1	Yeah, why choose to gain immunity through getting sick, recovering, and potentially dealing with long COVID, when one can just get a few spaced out shots instead and go on with their lives?
0	Yeah, why would anyone stop taking a medication that isn't helping their problem and causes debilitating side effects? So baffling.
1	Yes I'm glad I got the vaccine.
1	Yes Vaccine is "LIFE SAVING" Thank you.
0	Yes rest in peace my family and friends that were vaxed joe, Jessica, Karen, kevin, noma ....
1	Yes the vaccines and boosters works fine I'm alive and well and I got all of them even one of my hardcore heavy Trump-humping ex co-worker conspiracy guys said I'd be dead by December 2022 getting those.....Well it's February 2024 I'm doing well.....
1	Yes! Everyone associated with healthcare needs to be vaccinated. Thank you.
1	Yes, please let the public know that our scientists and medical professionals are working hard for the good of the people! ALL PEOPLE!!
1	Yes, yes, yes, a thousand times yes. You may have a sore arm and fatigue for a few days and that's very likely it. Get the vaccine.
1	Yes. I have had my two shots and three boosters. I will get another booster this weekend and my year flu shot. I am thankful for not being very susceptible to viruses, my wife came down with Covid in May, and I escaped without getting it. I tested myself every 5 days and nada!
1	Yesterday i got the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. First night who i sleep good after one year, thanks!
1	Yet again… more evidence that vaccines help to keep people out of the hospital. How much more data do people need to finally understand?
0	You ain’t fooling us again. Whole things a scam.
0	You are corrupt chemical killers
0	You call it side effects, I call it direct effects. No poison in my body!
0	You can expect blood clots
0	You can have my dose.....keep that experimental biological agent. If I wanted to participate in a clinical trial, it would be for something legitimate....
0	You can still pass and catch corona so that among many other things is why I’m not taking it
0	You couldn't even trust them with baby powder! Why trust them with a vaccine??
0	You don't have to be an "antivaxxer" to understand the stupidity this year
0	You don't need to be vaccinated against a virus with a 99% recovery rate!
0	You don't need to take a vaccine for the measles all you have to do is treat it my family we all had measles as kids we didn't go to the doctor to have a shot for the measles all we did is get some calamine lotion put it on took care of the itching and after so many days the virus was gone two weeks and I was back in school
0	You don’t most likely it’s just another toxic chemical you’ll put into your body .. cancers aren’t natural peeps .. man made toxins do bad things to your body .. your greatest hope is cancer shows it’s face at about 80 years old when your at the end anyhow
1	You guys are ok to be a little scared, it's a new kind of vaccine but it should be fine.
0	You have to sign a waiver before you take it saying that you won't blame the government or the medical office if something goes bad or you get deathly ill from it. But yeah, seems pretty safe to me.
0	You just won the jackpot of one million blood clots. Congratulations.
1	You know right now we really need a covid vaccine right now
0	You know what, fuck if. I got all 3 shots of phizer, caught Covid twice, and now I’m left with LVH, and all other sorts of issues from my last booster. I don’t care about saying it anymore, I’m pissed.
1	You probably have the unrealistic expectation that a vaccine must be 100% effective and 100.000% risk free or it's completely useless.
0	You protect them by not getting them vaxed
1	You risk death to get the "Natural Immunity". In theory, the vaccine risk is lower.
0	You should ask Bill Gates why he never vaccinated his family. If you get the answer to why then you’ll know my answer why.
1	You should make vaccines As early as you can
0	You shouldn’t trust the vaccine! It kills people!
0	You take it and all your friends and family. I'll see what happens at least 5 years down the track. 30 years research on these types of vaccines, no success, in less than a year, success, bingo, suspicious????????????????????
0	You won’t know what it’s done to your body for years to come
1	You'd think if the government wanted to kill people, it wouldn't be the ones actually willing to listen and vaccinate themselves. If Covid-19 was actually a government conspiracy. Logic would dictate that vaccination would actually be your only form of survival.
0	You're all lairs and' very unfair and' so unfaithful to the peoples' worldwide's pleasing bill gates and melinda gates' hates crimes just for money
0	Young athletes in tip top shape dropping from heart attacks or worse in the USA. That’s not normal.
0	Your not safe but hey all these drug companies are richer
0	Your own immune system is better without interruption.
1	Your refusal to get vaccinated has landed my cousin in the hospital with what doctors can only assume is Invisible Asymptomatic Very Long Covid (AVLC). This is hard to treat and requires round-the-clock care.
1	Your risk of health complications is overwhelmingly higher in every age group if you don’t get vaccinated than if you do. This is scientifically accurate information.
0	Your vaccines are dangerous
1	You’d be hard pressed to find anywhere close to 80 Canadian deaths of any persons that could be linked to the vaccines. The vaccines are safe and they work.
0	Yup, and i still got no covid vaccine to date. No matter how many times my doctor pushes it.
1	Yup. By the time I get it it'll have been more than a year since I last saw my mum, so after getting injected I'll be heading directly to the airport.
0	a lot of people in our area died after vaccination against covid, including those relatively young under 50 years old.
1	a similar vaccine, had a similar case during clinical trials
0	a vaccine developed in 6-12months is giving doubts
0	a vax for flu & colds is a profit making venture not a humanitarian effort ..
1	absolutely ingenious! those who had the mind to manipulate mRNA in such a way deserve respect.
0	all of my unvaxxed family experienced little to no symptoms upon catching covid and only got it once or twice. vaxxed family has had it multiple times with horrible reactions
1	all the dislikes are anti survivers
1	all the people scared of a VACCINE in the comments are pathetic. id rather be injected with a faulty vaccine than be infected with a disease that KILLS PEOPLE
1	am.full support of the vaccine I we always against those people that says bad thing about the vaccine
0	and now they want to vaccinate the entire world with their covid vaccine and ignoring all these adverse reactions from these other vaccines to our children!
1	anti-vaxers are such complete morons.
1	avoiding all vaccines because you had a bad reaction... is like avoiding all fruit because you ended up being allergic to apples...
1	basically if you get side effects from the vaccine it means it's working. I wish people can understand this.
0	boosters are dumb
0	certain false behaviors in the promotion of vaccines
0	coming back with the injection terrorism
0	continue with the testing and ensure it's safe before distribution
0	count me in too. im now an antivaxxer.
1	do anti-vaxxer's kids have mid-life crises' at age 3?
0	don't take their vaccines, do your own research please people. information is being silenced
1	don’t feel bad after the vaccine
0	drug that doesn't have any long-term test results
0	everyone that never had the shot in my family never had covid including myself one aunt gets regular flu shots nothing happens gets covid shot and rash headache dry cough dizziness the shakes leg aches felt awful for two weeks never had the shot again
1	feel better being protected
1	feel good after injecting
0	feel unwell after the vaccine
1	fighting this pandemic
0	final conclusion: avoid vaccine at all costs
1	funny thing is... you are probably only still alive now because of the vaccines you and others have already taken
1	get vaccinated
0	good luck forcing me getting that sh....t
0	good luck with your poison shots!
1	good sooner we can get a vaccine the better.
1	got my first dose of pfizer yesterday. been feeling like shit for a while now. but glad i got one
1	got my second vaccine an hour ago, I love this country!
0	hahaha the guy who at the beginning of the video admits to sponsoring the video with some kind of application decided to get credibility for the dubious poison injection of a billion-dollar business
1	have been vaccinated and think it’s not bad
0	he'd probably still be living had he not gotten the vaccination.
1	help to get antibodies
0	hi im opposed to getting the shot its trash
1	hopefully people will choose to get vaccinated instead of refusing them.
1	how is it in 2023 people are still scared of the COVID vaccine? We have nearly 3 years of data showing that it is save and effective.
1	i am going to get the vaccine but i am so scared of needles
1	i don’t care how long it lasts, if i need to get another dose next week, i’ll be the first in line!
1	i finally realised why i was sick for 2 weeks after getting the needles in me. it's to build memory cell so in the future i don't get sick easily and fight off bacteria faster.
1	i got hit by covid x2 and after vaccines are available in our country i never had a second thought and told our medical professionals "here's my arm. hit me hard " 😆
1	i got my Pfizer second dose yesterday!
0	i live in NH. my doctor tried talking me into the vaccine today i’m pregnant... they have no studies on how that would effect the baby or me 😂 she goes well we think it’s safe. y’all also thought the polio vaccine was safe and look how that worked out.
1	i love how the lady in the beginning said she had family members injured by vaccines but never gave any proof or even explained it at all
0	i love how they leave out the fact these trails are expected to be finished by 2023 and none of these vaccines are FDA approved
1	i was down for 2 whole days after second vaccine. at that time i was in bad shape, and i was happy i got it. if i got the real infection , it would have been much much worse. so better to suffer for 2 days than in breathing help machine for months.
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated!
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends.
1	i've had 2 shots. no reaction at all the 2nd time. makes me wonder if i need to get another shot later this year. like, in the fall or late summer.
0	if they're saying that we are too many on the planet., can you really trust these people coming up with a vaccine from a man made virus?
1	if we hadn't treated covid as a political issue instead of the health issue it really is, we really would've gotten a lot more done by now
1	if you assume it is from the vaccine then you must assume also that the Wild virus COVID 19 itself, especially if you catch it unvaccinated, would've got you more cardiovascular complications/ severely ill. Consultation and following with a cardiologist would be the best thing to do in you case. But not to stay unprotected/ unvaccinated, especially if you are experiencing cardiovascular problem. It might be coincidental, there might be even family history for heart conditions. It might be a mild complication as you got COVID itself while being vaccinated (as I mentioned), so please try not to jump into conclusions Instead seek professional advice, there are certain heart condition that favor a type of vaccine over the other and a good physician will tell you if it is advisable or not and when to take a booster vaccine. Just stay informed through a physician/ cardiologist
0	if you’re smart enough and have a clear mindset, you won’t get vaccinated. if you wanna play russian roulette have fun and take it.
1	im going to get whatever vaccine available next.
0	im good, ill take my chances.

1	just got my second dose on monday. only a week and one day until im fully vaccinated
1	l salute those who work hard and bring this vaccine, it will make a difference to those who is ineed and l like it.
1	luckily for me i only ever got a bit of a sore arm for a few hours the next day. though i think that has more to do with it just being a needle injection.
0	mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Caused More Deaths Than Saved: Study
1	mRNA actually has been used alot, just not for vaccines, it was most commonly used to fight cancer cells.
1	modern medicine is so god damn incredible.
1	my 11 yr old bro got his 1st dose today. He’s a real trooper & took it without a flinch!
1	my 80 year old parents had the 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccine and they had no side effects. I'm getting a shot Tuesday because nothing bad happened to them
0	my friend took the vaccine she’s seriously messed up now i took a video of her on my channel ,messed up stuff man
1	my grandmother has a scar from one of the earliest measles vaccine just after ww2 she was about 6 year’s old but she was grateful for it as one of the neighbours kid didn’t get it and died of measles when they where 7
1	my parents are scared of the vaccine since " it changes our DNA" and i can give us " auntoinmune reactions and gullian barre"... how do i explain to them is not like that

0	personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
0	really......nothing but $$$$$$ for big pharma
1	reported case numbers are so very small, it is difficult to comment on the exact amount of risk involved
0	rubbish they are not tested to the proper standards plenty of people have already died,through these vaccines,because they are bumped passed the testing quality time im not having it for sure
0	shutting down the whole world for a year or more because of the virus, making people aware of danger to avoid in any way possible catching it, and now urging and encouraging them to put it in the body? where's the logic?
1	so glad i could help end this pandemic :) getting my second dose soon!!!
1	so happy to say that I got my first dose of Moderna today. I signed up as soon as my university offered doses here, even though I tend to be a massive procrastinator. I want to keep my family and friends safe :)
0	some people have side effects after being vaccinated
0	still unmasked, still unvaccinated and OMG still alive
0	that vaccines are preventing millions of deaths is the real misinformation
1	the amount of anti-vaxxers in the comments is scary. if you don't want the vaccine, do not complain about no getting to travel this summer/this year. just judging from these comments the pandemic won't be over in america for years..... anyways i get my vaccine tmr, wish me luck!!!!!
1	the best vaccine I could get, there is no doubt that I will always be grateful to the Russians for such a wonderful vaccine...!!!

1	the effectiveness of the vaccine is not bad
1	the government explains the effectiveness of the vaccine
1	the only side effect i had was a massive headache which lasted for two days. took a painkiller for that.
0	the problem is the data that they have are all small values. And small values are easily changed.

1	the vaccine is developed by a trusted company
